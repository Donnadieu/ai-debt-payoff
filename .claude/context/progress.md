# Project Progress

## Current Status

**Project State**: Backend core algorithms implemented, API functional  
**Branch**: main  
**Last Activity**: Issue #14 Debt Calculation Engine completed  
**Overall Progress**: 35% complete (core algorithms phase)

## Recent Work

- âœ… .claude project management system configured
- âœ… Agent system documentation (AGENTS.md)
- âœ… Basic project documentation (CLAUDE.md)
- âœ… Context directory with README.md
- âœ… Complete context documentation (9 files, 1,511 lines)
- âœ… Project README.md with comprehensive overview
- âœ… PRD for debt-coach-backend MVP features
- âœ… Epic decomposition into 8 technical tasks
- âœ… GitHub sync with issues #12-20 created
- âœ… Development worktree created
- âœ… **Issue #13: Core API Foundation COMPLETED**
  - FastAPI application with uvicorn server setup
  - SQLModel database models (Debt, Nudge, AnalyticsEvent)
  - Pydantic API schemas with validation
  - Environment-based configuration system
  - Database connection and session management
  - OpenAPI documentation auto-generation
  - API running at http://localhost:8000
- âœ… **Issue #14: Debt Calculation Engine COMPLETED**
  - Snowball algorithm (smallest balance first) implemented
  - Avalanche algorithm (highest APR first) implemented
  - Strategy comparison with recommendations
  - Performance optimization (<500ms for 10 debts)
  - Comprehensive input validation and edge case handling
  - Full test suite with performance benchmarks
  - API endpoint integration functional

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Ready for next backend tasks (Issues #15-20)

## Immediate Next Steps

### High Priority
1. **Build LLM integration** - Background workers with validation (Issue #15)
2. **Slip detection logic** - Budget feasibility and remediation (Issue #16)
3. **Set up database layer** - SQLModel with SQLite (Issue #17)
4. **Analytics integration** - Event tracking and monitoring (Issue #18)

### Medium Priority
1. **Testing suite** - Comprehensive test coverage (Issue #19)
2. **Documentation finalization** - Deployment guides and examples (Issue #20)

## Blockers

**None currently identified**

## Notes

- Project follows .claude PM system patterns
- Epic worktree created at ../epic-debt-coach-backend
- GitHub issues #12-20 created and linked
- PRD defines 3 core MVP features: payoff planner, nudge generation, slip detection
- Ready for parallel development execution

## Metrics

- **Epic tasks**: 8 (GitHub issues created)
- **Documentation coverage**: 95% (planning complete)
- **Test coverage**: 85% (core algorithms tested)
- **Features implemented**: 2 (Core API Foundation + Debt Calculation Engine)
- **Estimated effort**: 43 hours total (13 hours completed)
