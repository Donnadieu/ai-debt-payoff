# PRD: Mobile App Deployment

## Executive Summary

Develop and deploy a React Native mobile application for the AI Debt Payoff Planner to both iOS and Android app stores. The mobile app will provide full feature parity with the backend API while adding mobile-specific enhancements like push notifications and offline functionality to improve user engagement and accessibility.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
The AI Debt Payoff Planner currently exists only as a backend API without a user-facing interface. Users need a convenient, always-accessible way to manage their debt payoff journey, track progress, and receive timely reminders.

**Why is this important now?**
- Mobile apps provide better marketing reach through app store discovery
- Users expect mobile-first financial tools for daily money management
- Push notifications can significantly improve payment compliance
- Offline access ensures users can always view their financial data

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas
1. **Debt-Struggling Individual** - Person with multiple debts seeking structured payoff guidance
2. **Financial Goal Setter** - Organized individual wanting to optimize debt payoff strategy
3. **Forgetful Payer** - Someone who needs reminders and motivation to stick to payment schedules

### User Journeys

**New User Onboarding:**
- Downloads app from App Store/Google Play
- Creates account and sets up authentication
- Adds debt information (balances, interest rates, minimum payments)
- Selects preferred payoff strategy (snowball vs avalanche)
- Configures payment reminders and notification preferences

**Daily Usage:**
- Opens app to check progress and upcoming payments
- Records debt payments when made
- Reviews AI coaching messages and suggestions
- Checks analytics to see payoff timeline improvements

**Offline Usage:**
- Views current debt balances and payment schedule without internet
- Records payments that sync when connection restored
- Accesses previously loaded coaching insights

### Pain Points Being Addressed
- No current user interface to access debt planning features
- Lack of convenient debt tracking on mobile devices
- Missing payment reminders leading to late fees
- Inability to access financial data without internet connection

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Core Features:**
- Multi-debt tracking with detailed debt information management
- Strategy comparison between debt snowball and avalanche methods
- AI coaching with personalized nudges and coaching messages
- Slip detection for monitoring plan deviations
- Analytics and progress tracking with performance metrics
- User authentication and secure data storage

**Mobile-Specific Features:**
- Push notifications for payment reminders
- Offline data access and synchronization
- Touch-friendly interface optimized for mobile screens
- Biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, fingerprint)
- Background sync when app returns online

**User Interface:**
- Dashboard showing debt overview and progress
- Individual debt detail screens
- Payment entry and history tracking
- Strategy comparison visualizations
- Settings and notification preferences
- AI coaching message center

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance:**
- App launch time under 3 seconds on average devices
- Offline data access with zero loading time
- Smooth animations and transitions (60fps)
- Background sync completion within 30 seconds

**Security:**
- End-to-end encryption for all financial data
- Secure local storage using platform keychain services
- OAuth 2.0 authentication with backend API
- Biometric authentication for app access
- Automatic logout after inactivity

**Scalability:**
- Support for unlimited number of debts per user
- Efficient local database for offline storage
- Optimized API calls to minimize data usage
- Memory usage under 100MB during normal operation

**Cross-Platform:**
- Consistent UI/UX across iOS and Android
- Platform-specific design patterns where appropriate
- Native performance on both platforms

## Success Criteria

**Launch Metrics:**
- Successfully deploy to both App Store and Google Play Store
- Zero critical bugs in initial release
- App store approval within first submission attempt

**User Adoption:**
- 1,000+ downloads within first month
- 70%+ user retention after 7 days
- 4.0+ average rating on app stores

**Engagement:**
- 60%+ of users enable push notifications
- Average 3+ sessions per week per active user
- 80%+ of payments recorded through mobile app

**Technical Performance:**
- 99.9% app stability (crash-free rate)
- Under 3 second average app launch time
- Successful offline-to-online sync rate of 95%+

## Constraints & Assumptions

**Technical Constraints:**
- Must use React Native with TypeScript
- Backend API already exists and should not be modified
- Must work offline with local data synchronization
- Push notifications required for both platforms

**Timeline Constraints:**
- ASAP delivery timeline requires MVP approach
- Simultaneous iOS and Android launch preferred
- No existing mobile development experience on team

**Resource Constraints:**
- Single developer (vibe coding approach)
- Learning curve for React Native and mobile deployment
- App store approval processes and potential delays
- Apple Developer Program and Google Play Console fees

**Platform Assumptions:**
- Users have iOS 12+ or Android 8+ devices
- Users will grant notification permissions
- Stable internet connection available for initial setup
- Users comfortable with biometric authentication

## Out of Scope

**Phase 1 Exclusions:**
- Web version of the application
- iPad/tablet optimization (phone-first)
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Social sharing features
- Multiple user accounts per device
- Advanced budgeting tools beyond debt payoff
- Integration with banks or financial institutions
- In-app purchases or subscription features
- Multi-language support
- Accessibility compliance beyond basic requirements

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies:**
- Apple Developer Program membership ($99/year)
- Google Play Console account ($25 one-time)
- Push notification service (Firebase Cloud Messaging)
- App store review and approval processes
- Backend API stability and availability

**Internal Dependencies:**
- Completion of backend API foundation
- React Native development environment setup
- Mobile device testing capabilities
- Code signing certificates and provisioning profiles
- CI/CD pipeline for mobile app builds

**Third-Party Services:**
- Expo or React Native CLI for development
- AsyncStorage or SQLite for offline data
- React Native Keychain for secure storage
- React Navigation for app navigation
- Notifee or similar for local notifications

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk:**
- App store rejection due to policy violations
- Performance issues with offline synchronization
- Learning curve impacting delivery timeline

**Medium Risk:**
- Platform-specific bugs requiring native code
- Push notification delivery reliability
- Data migration from offline to online state

**Low Risk:**
- Minor UI/UX differences between platforms
- App store fee costs
- Initial user adoption rates

## Success Monitoring

**Technical Metrics:**
- App crash reports and error tracking
- API response times and success rates
- Offline sync success/failure rates
- Push notification delivery rates

**Business Metrics:**
- Daily/monthly active users
- Session duration and frequency
- Payment completion rates
- User retention cohorts
- App store ratings and reviews

## Next Steps

1. Set up React Native development environment
2. Create basic app structure and navigation
3. Implement core debt tracking features
4. Add offline storage and synchronization
5. Integrate push notifications
6. Platform-specific testing and optimization
7. App store preparation and submission
8. Post-launch monitoring and iteration

This PRD serves as the foundation for implementing a comprehensive mobile debt payoff planning solution that will provide users with convenient, always-accessible financial management tools while meeting aggressive time-to-market requirements.
