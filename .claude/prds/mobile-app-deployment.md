# PRD: Debt Coach Mobile MVP

## Executive Summary

The Debt Coach Mobile MVP is a cross-platform React Native application that empowers users to pay off debt faster through personalized payoff plans, visual progress tracking, and AI-powered coaching nudges. This MVP focuses on delivering immediate value with 3 core features while connecting to an existing FastAPI backend, emphasizing speed-to-market and habit formation for monetization.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
Millions of people struggle with debt but lack the tools and motivation to create and stick to effective payoff strategies. Current solutions are either too complex, lack personalization, or fail to provide ongoing motivation and guidance.

**Why is this important now?**
- Rising consumer debt levels and interest rates
- Growing demand for financial wellness tools
- Mobile-first approach to personal finance management
- Opportunity to leverage AI for personalized financial coaching
- Proven market demand for debt management solutions

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes
- **User Acquisition**: 1,000+ downloads within first month
- **Engagement**: 70%+ DAU (Daily Active Users) retention after onboarding
- **Feature Adoption**: 80%+ of users complete debt input and generate plan
- **Monetization**: 5%+ conversion to premium subscription
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.5+ star rating in app stores

### Key Metrics and KPIs
- Time to first value (debt plan generated) < 5 minutes
- Session frequency: 3+ times per week average
- Payment tracking usage: 60%+ of users log payments
- AI nudge engagement: 40%+ users interact with coaching content
- Churn rate < 10% monthly after first month

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must use React Native with Expo for cross-platform development
- Backend integration limited to existing FastAPI endpoints
- No native device integrations (camera, biometrics) in MVP
- SQLite for local storage, no complex database requirements

### Timeline Constraints
- 6-week development timeline with single developer
- App store approval process may add 1-2 weeks
- Must prioritize core features over polish for speed-to-market

### Resource Constraints
- Single React Native developer
- Existing backend team for API support
- Limited budget for third-party services
- No dedicated UI/UX designer (use established patterns)

### Assumptions
- FastAPI backend is stable and can handle mobile traffic
- Users will manually input debt information (no bank integration)
- Firebase Auth will meet security and compliance needs
- GluestackUI v3 provides sufficient components for MVP
- Market validation exists for debt payoff mobile apps

## Out of Scope

**Explicitly NOT building in MVP:**
- Push notifications and reminders
- Bank account integration or automated payment tracking
- Receipt scanning or expense categorization
- Social features or community aspects
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Biometric authentication
- Custom themes beyond dark/light mode
- AI chat interface (only feed-style nudges)
- Multiple user accounts or family sharing
- Export to external financial tools
- Investment advice or other financial products
- Web application version

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **Apple Developer Program**: Required for iOS app store deployment
- **Google Play Console**: Required for Android app store deployment  
- **Expo Account**: For managed workflow and EAS builds
- **Firebase Project**: For authentication services

### Internal Dependencies
- **FastAPI Backend MVP**: Must be completed and stable
- **Backend API Endpoints**: `/plan`, `/nudge/generate`, `/slip/check`
- **LLM Content Validation**: Backend pipeline for safe AI content
- **Database Schema**: User data and debt information storage

### Third-Party Service Dependencies
- **Firebase Auth**: User authentication and management
- **Expo EAS**: Build and deployment pipeline
- **React Navigation**: Navigation framework
- **GluestackUI v3**: Component library
- **SQLite**: Local data persistence

## Risk Mitigation

**Scope Creep Risk**
- Strict feature lockdown - only 3 core features in MVP
- Regular milestone reviews to prevent feature additions
- Clear "out of scope" documentation shared with stakeholders

**Technical Risks**
- Offline-first architecture ensures app works without internet
- Comprehensive error handling for API failures
- Local data backup and recovery mechanisms

**Content Safety Risk**
- LLM validation pipeline prevents hallucinated financial numbers
- Human review of AI coaching content templates
- Fallback to static motivational content if AI fails

**Monetization Risk**
- Early paywall testing with beta users
- Multiple pricing tiers and billing cycles tested
- Clear value proposition for premium features

**Timeline Risk**
- Weekly milestone checkpoints and scope adjustment
- Core functionality prioritized over polish
- Parallel development of store approval process
