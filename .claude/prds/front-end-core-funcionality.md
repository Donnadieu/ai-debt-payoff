# PRD: Front-End Core Functionality

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the complete frontend application for the AI Debt Payoff Planner. The frontend will be a React TypeScript application with Tailwind CSS that provides intuitive debt management, interactive strategy comparison, AI-powered coaching, and comprehensive progress tracking. The application must integrate seamlessly with the existing FastAPI backend and deliver a professional, trustworthy experience for users managing their personal debt repayment strategies.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
The AI Debt Payoff Planner backend provides powerful debt optimization APIs, AI coaching, and analytics capabilities, but currently has no user interface. Users cannot access these valuable features without a frontend application that makes complex financial calculations and AI insights accessible through an intuitive, professional interface.

**Why is this important now?**
- The backend API is complete and ready for frontend integration
- Users need immediate access to debt optimization tools in an easy-to-use format
- The market demands comprehensive debt management solutions with AI guidance
- Visual interfaces are essential for users to understand and trust financial recommendations

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas

**Persona 1: Sarah - Debt Optimizer**
- 32-year-old professional with multiple credit cards and student loans
- Tech-savvy, wants data-driven debt payoff strategies
- Values efficiency and clear progress tracking

**Persona 2: Mike - Financial Beginner**
- 25-year-old with first-time debt management experience
- Needs guidance and motivation to stay on track
- Prefers simple, intuitive interfaces with helpful explanations

**Persona 3: Lisa - Busy Parent**

### Detailed User Journeys

**New User Onboarding**
- As a new user, I want to quickly understand the app's value proposition
- As a new user, I want a guided debt entry process that doesn't feel overwhelming
- As a new user, I want to see immediate strategy recommendations after entering my debts
- As a new user, I want clear explanations of debt payoff strategies

**Daily User Experience**
- As a returning user, I want to see my debt progress immediately on the dashboard
