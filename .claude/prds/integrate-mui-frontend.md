# PRD: integrate-mui-frontend

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the comprehensive integration of Material-UI (MUI) v7 components across the AI Debt Payoff application's frontend. The integration will replace existing Tailwind-based custom components with MUI's robust, accessible, and professionally designed component library while maintaining the application's functionality and improving user experience.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**
- Frontend has custom components built with Tailwind CSS
- MUI dependencies are already installed but not actively used
- Components lack consistent design system implementation
- Manual styling maintenance overhead
- Limited accessibility features in custom components

**Problems Being Solved:**
- Inconsistent UI/UX across components
- High maintenance overhead for custom styling
- Missing accessibility features
- Lack of standardized design patterns
- Time-intensive component development

**Why This is Important Now:**
- MUI is already installed as a dependency (v7.3.2)
- Custom components need standardization before feature expansion
- Accessibility compliance requirements
- Faster development velocity for future features

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas
- **End Users**: People managing debt payoff strategies
- **Developers**: Frontend team building and maintaining the application

### User Journeys

**As an End User:**
- I want consistent, intuitive UI components so I can easily navigate the debt payoff application
- I want accessible form controls so I can input my debt information regardless of my abilities
- I want responsive design that works on all my devices
- I want professional-looking data tables and charts for my debt analysis

**As a Developer:**
- I want standardized components so I can build features faster
- I want well-documented component APIs so I can implement features correctly
- I want accessible components by default so I don't need to implement accessibility manually
- I want theming capabilities so I can maintain consistent branding

### Pain Points Being Addressed
- Inconsistent button styles and behaviors across the app
- Custom form components lacking validation feedback
- Tables and data displays without sorting/filtering capabilities
- Modal dialogs without proper focus management
- Loading states without standardized spinners

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Core Component Migration:**
- Replace all existing custom components with MUI equivalents:
  - Button → MUI Button with variants (primary, secondary, danger, outline)
  - Input/FormField → MUI TextField with validation states
  - Select → MUI Select with proper dropdown behavior
  - TextArea → MUI TextField multiline
  - Card → MUI Card with consistent elevation
  - Modal → MUI Dialog with proper focus management
  - Alert → MUI Alert with severity levels
  - Loading → MUI CircularProgress and LinearProgress
  - Navigation → MUI AppBar, Drawer, and Breadcrumbs

**Data Display Components:**
- DebtList → MUI DataGrid or Table with sorting/filtering
- DebtCard → MUI Card with structured content layout
- Charts integration with MUI theming

**Form Components:**
- DebtForm → MUI form components with react-hook-form integration
- Form validation with MUI error states
- Bulk actions with MUI selection controls

**Navigation Components:**
- App navigation with MUI AppBar
- Side navigation with MUI Drawer
- Breadcrumb navigation with MUI Breadcrumbs

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance:**
- Bundle size increase should not exceed 200KB
- Component rendering performance maintained or improved
- Tree-shaking enabled for unused MUI components

**Accessibility:**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance through MUI's built-in accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management in modals and forms

**Theming:**
- Custom theme matching existing brand colors
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Dark/light mode support preparation
- Responsive breakpoints aligned with current design

**Browser Support:**
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile responsive design
- Touch-friendly interactions

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes
- **Component Coverage**: 100% of existing custom components migrated to MUI
- **Accessibility Score**: Lighthouse accessibility score ≥ 95
- **Bundle Size**: Total bundle size increase ≤ 200KB
- **Development Velocity**: 30% faster component development for new features
- **Code Reduction**: 40% reduction in custom CSS/styling code

### Key Metrics and KPIs
- Number of custom components replaced
- Accessibility audit score improvements
- Developer satisfaction with component API
- User testing feedback on UI consistency
- Performance metrics (Core Web Vitals)

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing functionality during migration
- Cannot break existing API integrations
- Must work with current React 19 and TypeScript setup
- Vite build system compatibility required

### Timeline Constraints
- Migration should be completed in phases to avoid disruption
- Each component migration should be independently deployable
- Testing required for each migrated component

### Resource Constraints
- Single developer working on migration
- Limited QA resources for comprehensive testing
- Must maintain current development velocity

### Assumptions
- MUI v7 APIs are stable and well-documented
- Existing component props can be mapped to MUI equivalents
- Current Tailwind classes can be replaced with MUI theming
- React Hook Form integration with MUI works as expected

## Out of Scope

**Explicitly NOT Building:**
- Custom MUI component extensions beyond basic theming
- Migration to different React frameworks (Next.js, etc.)
- Complete redesign of user workflows
- Backend API changes
- Mobile native app components
- Advanced MUI features like DataGrid Pro
- Custom icon library (using MUI Icons)
- Animation libraries beyond MUI's built-in transitions

## Risk Mitigation

**High Risk - Component API Differences:**
- Mitigation: Create wrapper components to maintain existing prop interfaces
- Fallback: Gradual migration with hybrid approach

**Medium Risk - Bundle Size Increase:**
- Mitigation: Enable tree-shaking and analyze bundle composition
- Fallback: Selective component imports and lazy loading

**Low Risk - Theme Customization Complexity:**
- Mitigation: Start with default theme and iterate
- Fallback: Use CSS-in-JS overrides for complex customizations
