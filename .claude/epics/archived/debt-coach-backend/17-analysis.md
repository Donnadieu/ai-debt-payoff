# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #17

## Overview
Set up SQLite database with SQLModel/SQLAlchemy integration, create database migrations, and implement data persistence layer for nudges, analytics events, and user sessions. This is foundational database work that can be highly parallelized across different components.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Database Foundation & Configuration
**Scope**: Core database setup, connection management, and configuration
**Files**:
- `backend/database.py`
- `backend/config.py` (database settings)
- `backend/app/core/database.py`
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 1.5 hours
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream B: Schema Models & Migrations
**Scope**: SQLModel definitions and Alembic migration setup
**Files**:
- `backend/app/schemas/nudge.py`
- `backend/app/schemas/analytics.py`
- `backend/app/schemas/user.py`
- `backend/migrations/env.py`
- `backend/migrations/versions/*.py`
- `backend/alembic.ini`
**Agent Type**: database-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 2 hours
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream C: Data Access Layer & Services
**Scope**: Repository patterns, CRUD operations, and transaction management
**Files**:
- `backend/app/core/repository.py`
- `backend/app/services/nudge_service.py`
- `backend/app/services/analytics_service.py`
- `backend/app/core/transaction.py`
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: after Stream A completes
**Estimated Hours**: 1.5 hours
**Dependencies**: Stream A (database connection)

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
- `backend/requirements.txt` - All streams may add dependencies
- `backend/app/__init__.py` - Database initialization imports

### Sequential Requirements
1. Database connection setup before data access layer
2. Schema models before migrations can be generated
3. Core database before service layer implementation

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Streams work on different functional areas
- **Medium Risk**: Shared requirements.txt and init files
- **High Risk**: None - well-separated concerns

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: hybrid

Launch Streams A & B simultaneously (database setup + schema design are independent). Start Stream C when Stream A completes, as it needs the database connection infrastructure.

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- Wall time: 2 hours (max of Stream B)
- Total work: 4 hours
- Efficiency gain: 50%

Without parallel execution:
- Wall time: 4 hours

## Notes
- Stream A and B can work completely independently
- Stream C requires database connection from Stream A but not schema models from Stream B
- All streams should coordinate on SQLModel/SQLAlchemy dependency versions
- PostgreSQL compatibility should be validated across all schema designs
- Consider using database-specialist for Stream B due to migration complexity
