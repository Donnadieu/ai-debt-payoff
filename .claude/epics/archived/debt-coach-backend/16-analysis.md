# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #16

## Overview
Implement budget feasibility analysis that detects when monthly budget is insufficient for minimum debt payments and provides actionable remediation suggestions using the rule: max($25, ceil(shortfall/25)*$25).

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Core Algorithm & Business Logic
**Scope**: Slip detection algorithm, shortfall calculation, and remediation suggestion logic
**Files**:
- `backend/app/services/slip_detector.py`
- `backend/app/core/calculations.py` (if needed for math utilities)
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 1.5
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream B: API Layer & Schemas
**Scope**: API endpoint, request/response schemas, and integration with FastAPI
**Files**:
- `backend/app/api/endpoints/slip.py`
- `backend/app/schemas/slip.py`
- `backend/app/main.py` (endpoint registration)
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 1
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream C: Testing & Analytics
**Scope**: Unit tests, edge case testing, and analytics event integration
**Files**:
- `backend/tests/test_slip_detector.py`
- `backend/tests/test_slip_api.py`
- `backend/app/services/analytics.py` (event tracking)
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: after Streams A & B have basic implementation
**Estimated Hours**: 1
**Dependencies**: Stream A (algorithm), Stream B (API structure)

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
No direct file conflicts expected:
- Each stream works on distinct files
- `main.py` only needs endpoint registration (minimal change)

### Sequential Requirements
1. Core algorithm (Stream A) should define interfaces before API layer uses them
2. API schemas (Stream B) should be defined before comprehensive testing
3. Analytics integration can happen in parallel with core development

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Streams work on different files with minimal overlap
- **Coordination Needed**: Stream C needs basic implementations from A & B
- **Integration Point**: Final testing requires all components working together

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: hybrid

Launch Streams A & B simultaneously for core development. Stream C starts when A & B have basic implementations ready (after ~1 hour of work).

**Coordination Timeline**:
- Hour 0-1: Streams A & B work independently
- Hour 1: Quick sync - A provides algorithm interface, B provides schema structure
- Hour 1-2: Stream C begins testing while A & B continue refinement
- Hour 2-3: Integration testing and final polish

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- Wall time: 2 hours (with proper coordination)
- Total work: 3.5 hours
- Efficiency gain: 43%

Without parallel execution:
- Wall time: 3.5 hours

## Notes

**Key Success Factors**:
- Stream A should expose clear interfaces early for Stream B integration
- Mathematical rule implementation must be exact: max($25, ceil(shortfall/25)*$25)
- Edge cases (zero budget, no debts) are critical for robust testing
- Analytics events should follow existing patterns in the codebase

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Keep algorithm simple and focused on the specific rule
- Ensure API response format is consistent with existing endpoints
- Test mathematical edge cases thoroughly (negative numbers, zero values)

**Dependencies Note**:
- Depends on Task 13 (Core API Foundation) - verify API structure exists
- May need existing debt portfolio schemas for integration
