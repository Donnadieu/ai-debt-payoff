## Integration with Stream B

Stream A has created the foundation documentation structure that Stream B can enhance with:
- Detailed API examples and curl commands
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation enhancements
- Code comments and business logic explanations
- Integration point documentation

## Files Created/Modified

1. `/README.md` - Comprehensive project overview and quick start guide
2. `/.env.example` - Complete environment configuration template
3. `/docs/setup.md` - Detailed setup and installation instructions
4. `/docs/architecture.md` - System architecture and design documentation
5. `/docs/` directory - Created documentation structure

## Verification

All documentation has been created with:
- ✅ Exact copy-paste commands that work out of the box
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage of setup scenarios
- ✅ Clear explanations of system architecture
- ✅ Environment configuration for all deployment types
- ✅ Troubleshooting guidance for common issues
- ✅ Integration points clearly marked for Stream B

## Stream A Status: COMPLETED

All assigned deliverables have been completed successfully. The documentation provides a complete foundation for:
1. New developers to set up and run the project locally
2. DevOps teams to deploy the system in production
3. Technical stakeholders to understand the architecture
4. Stream B to add detailed API documentation and examples

The project is now fully documented and ready for handoff or deployment.
