# Stream B: API Integration & Middleware

## Scope
Performance monitoring middleware and API endpoint integration

## Files
- `backend/app/middleware/analytics.py`
- `backend/app/middleware/performance.py`
- `backend/main.py` (middleware integration)
- API endpoint modifications for event tracking

## Status
- **Current Status**: completed
- **Started**: 2025-01-27
- **Completed**: 2025-01-27
- **Estimated Completion**: 2-3 hours
- **Dependencies**: None (can run parallel with Stream A)

## Progress
- [x] Performance monitoring middleware
- [x] API endpoint integration
- [x] Request/response tracking

## Completed Tasks
1. **Performance Monitoring Middleware** (`backend/app/middleware/performance.py`)
   - Implemented `PerformanceMiddleware` class for FastAPI integration
   - Added automatic request timing and performance tracking
   - Created analytics event tracking for API requests
   - Built error handling and exception tracking
   - Added response headers for performance metrics

2. **Analytics API Endpoints** (`backend/app/api/analytics.py`)
   - Created comprehensive analytics API with 12 endpoints
   - Implemented event tracking endpoints (`/track`, `/batch-track`)
   - Added performance monitoring endpoints (`/performance`, `/health`)
   - Built analytics statistics and configuration endpoints
   - Created user interaction tracking endpoints
   - Added event flushing and recent events retrieval

3. **Middleware Integration System**
   - Created `AnalyticsMiddleware` for user interaction tracking
   - Implemented sampling rate configuration for performance
   - Added middleware setup utilities with configuration options
   - Built health check integration for monitoring

## Current Work
Stream B implementation completed successfully.

## Next Steps
Stream B is complete. All middleware and API integration is ready for use.

## Notes
- FastAPI middleware fully integrated with analytics core
- API endpoints provide comprehensive analytics management
- Request/response tracking active with performance headers
- User interaction tracking implemented with sampling
- Ready for integration with main FastAPI application
