# Stream A: Core Algorithm & Business Logic

## Scope
Slip detection algorithm, shortfall calculation, and remediation suggestion logic

## Files
- `backend/app/services/slip_detector.py`
- `backend/app/core/calculations.py` (if needed for math utilities)

## Progress
- ✅ Implemented slip detection algorithm in `slip_detector.py`
- ✅ Core algorithm with max($25, ceil(shortfall/25)*$25) rule
- ✅ Edge case handling (zero budget, no debts, etc.)
- ✅ Decimal precision handling for accurate calculations
- ✅ Performance optimized for <50ms response time
