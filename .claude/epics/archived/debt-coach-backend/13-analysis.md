# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #13

## Overview

Set up FastAPI application foundation with basic routing, Pydantic models, and SQLModel database integration. This establishes the core project structure, configuration management, and basic API endpoints that other tasks will build upon.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Application Structure
**Scope**: FastAPI app setup, routing, and configuration
**Files**:
- `main.py` - FastAPI app and route definitions
- `config.py` - Environment configuration
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 2
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream B: Database Layer
**Scope**: SQLModel database models and connection setup
**Files**:
- `models.py` - SQLModel database models
- `database.py` - Database connection and session management
**Agent Type**: database-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 2
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream C: API Schemas
**Scope**: Pydantic request/response models for API validation
**Files**:
- `schemas.py` - Pydantic request/response models
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: after Stream A completes
**Estimated Hours**: 2
**Dependencies**: Stream A (needs FastAPI structure)

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
None - streams work on separate files

### Sequential Requirements
1. FastAPI app structure before API schemas
2. Database models can be developed independently
3. Configuration setup enables both database and API layers

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Streams work on different files with minimal overlap
- **Coordination needed**: Stream C waits for Stream A to establish routing patterns

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: hybrid

Launch Streams A & B simultaneously (independent foundation work). Start Stream C when Stream A completes to ensure proper API schema integration with established routing patterns.

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- Wall time: 4 hours (2 parallel + 2 sequential)
- Total work: 6 hours
- Efficiency gain: 33%

Without parallel execution:
- Wall time: 6 hours

## Notes
- Foundation task that unlocks other epic tasks
- Focus on clean architecture patterns for future extensibility
- Ensure database models are PostgreSQL-ready for production scaling
- OpenAPI documentation should auto-generate from schemas
