# Task: Analytics & Monitoring

## Description

Implement analytics event tracking system with console logging stub, performance monitoring hooks, and comprehensive event capture at key user interaction points. Ready for external analytics service integration.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Analytics event tracking function `analytics_event(name, props)`
- [ ] Console logging implementation for development
- [ ] Event tracking at all specified interaction points
- [ ] Performance monitoring for API response times
- [ ] Structured logging with correlation IDs
- [ ] Integration hooks for external analytics services
- [ ] Event schema validation and formatting
- [ ] Analytics event persistence in database

## Technical Details

- **Implementation**: Stub function with console output for development
- **Events**: add_debt, view_plan, nudge_generated, nudge_validated, nudge_rejected, nudge_sent, slip_alert_fired, slip_action_confirmed
- **Performance**: Response time tracking and logging
- **Integration**: Clear hooks for production analytics services
- **Files to create**:
  - `analytics.py` - Event tracking and logging system
  - Integration points in all API endpoints
  - Performance monitoring middleware

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 13 - Core API Foundation (for integration points)
- [ ] No external dependencies (stub implementation)

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: S
- **Hours**: 3 hours
- **Parallel**: true (independent monitoring layer)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Analytics function implemented and integrated
- [ ] All specified events tracked in code
- [ ] Console logging functional for development
- [ ] Performance monitoring active
- [ ] Integration hooks ready for production services
- [ ] Event data properly structured and validated
