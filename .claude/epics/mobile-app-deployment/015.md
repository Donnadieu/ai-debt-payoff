# Task: Testing and Quality Assurance

## Description

Implement comprehensive testing strategy including unit tests, integration tests, and device testing across iOS and Android platforms. Perform thorough bug fixing, performance optimization, and user experience refinement to ensure app store quality standards.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unit tests written for all utility functions and services
- [ ] Integration tests for API communication and sync logic
- [ ] Component tests for critical UI interactions
- [ ] Device testing performed on multiple iOS and Android devices
- [ ] Performance profiling and optimization completed
- [ ] Memory leak detection and resolution
- [ ] Crash testing and error boundary validation
- [ ] User experience testing and refinement

## Technical Details

- **Testing Stack**: Jest, React Native Testing Library, Detox (E2E)
- **Coverage**: 90%+ test coverage for business logic
- **Devices**: Testing on various screen sizes and OS versions
- **Performance**: Launch time, memory usage, battery impact analysis
- **Files to create**:
  - `__tests__/` - Comprehensive test suite directory
  - `e2e/` - End-to-end test scenarios
  - `scripts/test.sh` - Test automation scripts
  - `docs/testing-strategy.md` - Testing documentation
  - `performance/` - Performance test reports and benchmarks

## Dependencies

- [x] Task 008: Core Debt Management Features (for feature completeness)
- [x] Task 010: Offline Sync Logic Implementation (for sync testing)
- [x] Task 011: Push Notifications System (for notification testing)
- [x] Task 012: Background Sync and App State Management (for background testing)
- [ ] Physical iOS and Android devices for testing

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: L
- **Hours**: 20-24 hours
- **Parallel**: false (needs complete app functionality)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All critical user flows covered by automated tests
- [ ] App launches and runs smoothly on target devices
- [ ] Memory usage and performance within acceptable limits
- [ ] Offline functionality thoroughly tested and validated
- [ ] Push notifications working correctly on both platforms
- [ ] Error scenarios handled gracefully with user feedback
- [ ] App store submission-ready quality achieved
- [ ] Test documentation and automation completed
