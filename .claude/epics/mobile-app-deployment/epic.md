# Epic: Debt Coach Mobile MVP

## Overview

Deliver a minimal viable product (MVP) React Native mobile application focused on 3 core features: debt payoff plan generation, progress visualization, and AI coaching nudges. The MVP prioritizes speed-to-market with existing backend integration and offline-first architecture to provide immediate user value while establishing monetization foundation.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Framework**: React Native with Expo (managed workflow for speed)
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety
- **Navigation**: React Navigation v6 with bottom tab navigation
- **State Management**: React Query + Zustand (lightweight, offline-friendly)
- **Offline Storage**: SQLite for local persistence and offline-first functionality
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth (email/password primary, Google Sign-In optional)
- **UI Components**: GluestackUI v3 for consistent design system
- **API Integration**: Axios with retry logic and offline queue for backend communication

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **Debt Input Forms**: Simple form validation for balance, APR, minimum payment
- **Payoff Plan Generator**: Integration with FastAPI `/plan` endpoint for Snowball/Avalanche calculations  
- **Progress Dashboard**: Visual progress bars, countdown timers, and key metrics display
- **AI Coaching Feed**: In-app content feed consuming backend LLM insights
- **Basic Authentication**: Firebase Auth integration with secure token management
- **Offline Sync**: SQLite storage with background sync when connectivity restored

### Backend Services
- **Leverage Existing FastAPI Endpoints**:
  - `/plan` for debt payoff schedule calculations
  - `/nudge/generate` for AI coaching content
  - `/slip/check` for feasibility validation
- **Mobile API Extensions**: Add user sync and lightweight analytics endpoints
- **Content Validation**: Ensure LLM-generated coaching content is safe and accurate

### Infrastructure
- **Deployment**: Expo EAS for build and distribution pipeline
- **Data Storage**: Local SQLite with cloud backup through Firebase
- **Performance**: Offline-first with graceful degradation patterns
- **Monitoring**: Basic crash reporting and usage analytics

## Implementation Strategy

The MVP follows a strictly scoped 6-week timeline with parallel development approach:

**Week 1: Foundation Setup**
- Expo project with TypeScript and navigation structure
- GluestackUI integration and dark theme setup
- Firebase Auth implementation
- Basic screen layouts (Dashboard, Debts, Settings)

**Week 2: Debt Management Core**
- Debt input forms with validation
- SQLite schema and data persistence
- FastAPI integration for plan generation
- Snowball vs Avalanche strategy comparison UI

**Week 3: Progress Visualization** 
- Dashboard with progress indicators and charts
- Payment logging and history tracking
- Metrics calculations (debt remaining, interest saved, timeline)
- Milestone celebrations and achievements

**Week 4: AI Coaching Integration**
- Backend LLM integration for coaching nudges
- Content feed UI with personalized recommendations
- Safety validation and error handling
- Offline fallback content

**Week 5: Monetization & Polish**
- Subscription paywall implementation
- Premium feature gating
- UI accessibility improvements  
- Performance optimization and testing

**Week 6: Store Preparation & Launch**
- App store assets and metadata
- Final QA testing on devices
- Store submission process
- Production deployment and monitoring

## Task Breakdown Preview

High-level task categories for implementation:

- [ ] **Foundation Setup**: Expo project init, navigation, authentication, UI framework
- [ ] **Debt Management**: Input forms, data persistence, backend API integration
- [ ] **Progress Dashboard**: Visual components, metrics calculation, payment tracking
- [ ] **AI Coaching System**: LLM integration, content feed, safety validation
- [ ] **Authentication & Security**: Firebase Auth, data encryption, offline sync
- [ ] **Monetization Features**: Subscription paywall, premium gating, billing integration
- [ ] **Performance & Polish**: Optimization, accessibility, error handling
- [ ] **Testing & Quality**: Unit tests, integration tests, device testing
- [ ] **Store Deployment**: App store preparation, assets, submission process

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **Apple Developer Program**: iOS app store deployment
- **Google Play Console**: Android app store deployment
- **Expo Account**: Managed workflow and EAS builds
- **Firebase Project**: Authentication and cloud services

### Internal Dependencies  
- **FastAPI Backend**: Stable API endpoints for plan generation and coaching
- **Backend Team**: Support for mobile-specific API extensions
- **LLM Pipeline**: Content validation system for safe AI coaching

### Critical Path Items
1. FastAPI backend stability and mobile API readiness
2. Firebase Auth configuration and testing
3. SQLite schema design and migration strategy
4. App store developer account setup and approval workflow

## Success Criteria (Technical)

### Performance Benchmarks
- App launch time < 3 seconds on mid-range devices
- Offline functionality works seamlessly without network
- API response times < 2 seconds for plan generation
- 60fps smooth animations and navigation transitions

### Quality Gates
- 90%+ automated test coverage for core business logic
- Zero critical bugs in debt calculation algorithms
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Successful app store approval on first submission

### Acceptance Criteria
- Users can complete full debt input and plan generation offline
- AI coaching content displays safely with fallback mechanisms
- Subscription paywall converts users with clear value proposition
- Cross-device data sync works reliably

## Estimated Effort

**Timeline**: 6 weeks (single developer)
**Total Hours**: ~240 hours (40 hours/week)

**Resource Requirements**:
- 1 Senior React Native Developer (primary)
- Backend API support (existing team, ~8 hours)
- iOS and Android test devices
- App store developer accounts

**Critical Path**: Foundation → Debt Management → Progress Dashboard → AI Coaching → Monetization → Deployment

**Risk Buffer**: 20% additional time allocated for app store approval and unexpected integration issues
