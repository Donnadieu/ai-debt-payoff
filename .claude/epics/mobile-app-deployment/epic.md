# Epic: Mobile App Deployment

## Overview

Implement a cross-platform React Native mobile application with TypeScript that provides full debt payoff planning capabilities with offline functionality and push notifications. The app will leverage the existing FastAPI backend while adding mobile-specific features for enhanced user engagement and accessibility.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Framework**: React Native with Expo for rapid development and easier deployment
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- **Navigation**: React Navigation v6 for screen management
- **State Management**: React Query + Zustand (lightweight, works well offline)
- **Offline Storage**: SQLite with react-native-sqlite-storage for robust local data
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication with Google Sign-In and biometric fallback using react-native-keychain
- **Push Notifications**: Expo Notifications (handles both iOS and Android)
- **API Integration**: Axios with retry logic and offline queue management
- **UI Components**: GluestackUI v3 for consistent design. https://gluestack.io/ui/docs/home/getting-started/installation

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **Authentication Flow**: Firebase Auth login/register screens with Google Sign-In and biometric setup
- **Dashboard**: Debt overview with progress charts and next payment reminders
- **Debt Management**: Add/edit debt screens with form validation
- **Payment Tracking**: Quick payment entry with camera receipt scanning
- **Strategy Comparison**: Visual comparison of snowball vs avalanche methods
- **AI Coaching Center**: Message feed with coaching insights and motivational content
- **Settings**: Notification preferences, biometric settings, sync management

### Backend Services
- **Existing API Integration**: Leverage current FastAPI endpoints without modification
- **Sync Service**: Background synchronization between local SQLite and remote API
- **Notification Scheduler**: Local notification scheduling for payment reminders
- **Offline Queue**: Store API calls when offline, execute when connection restored

### Infrastructure
- **Development**: Expo CLI for development and testing
- **Build**: EAS Build for production app compilation
- **Distribution**: EAS Submit for app store deployment
- **Analytics**: Expo Analytics for usage tracking
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry integration for crash reporting

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases
1. **Foundation Setup** (Week 1): Project initialization, navigation, basic UI components
2. **Core Features** (Week 2-3): Authentication, debt CRUD operations, payment tracking
3. **Offline & Sync** (Week 4): SQLite integration, sync logic, offline capability
4. **Mobile Features** (Week 5): Push notifications, biometric auth, background sync
5. **Polish & Deploy** (Week 6): UI refinement, testing, app store submission

### Risk Mitigation
- Use Expo managed workflow to avoid native development complexity
- Implement offline-first architecture to handle connectivity issues
- Create comprehensive error boundaries and fallback UI states
- Use TypeScript strict mode to catch errors early

### Testing Approach
- Jest for unit testing utility functions
- React Native Testing Library for component tests
- Manual testing on both iOS and Android devices
- Expo Go for rapid testing during development

## Task Breakdown Preview

High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] **Project Setup**: Initialize React Native project with Expo, configure TypeScript, set up navigation
- [ ] **Authentication System**: Implement Firebase Auth login/register, Google Sign-In, biometric auth, secure token storage
- [ ] **Core UI Components**: Build reusable components, screens, and navigation structure
- [ ] **API Integration**: Connect to FastAPI backend, implement API client with error handling
- [ ] **Offline Data Management**: Set up SQLite, implement sync logic, handle offline scenarios
- [ ] **Push Notifications**: Configure notification permissions, scheduling, and delivery
- [ ] **App Store Preparation**: Configure build settings, create app store assets, handle submissions
- [ ] **Testing & Quality Assurance**: Write tests, perform device testing, fix bugs

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Apple Developer Program membership ($99/year)
- Google Play Console account ($25 one-time)
- Expo account for EAS Build and Submit services
- Backend API completion and stability

### Internal Dependencies
- Completion of backend API foundation
- Device access for testing (iOS and Android)
- App store developer accounts setup

### Third-Party Services
- Expo ecosystem (CLI, EAS Build/Submit, Notifications)
- Sentry for error tracking
- SQLite for offline storage
- React Navigation for navigation
- React Query for API state management

## Success Criteria (Technical)

### Performance Benchmarks
- App launch time < 3 seconds on mid-range devices
- Smooth 60fps animations and transitions
- Offline data access with zero loading delay
- Background sync completion < 30 seconds

### Quality Gates
- 100% TypeScript coverage (no any types)
- 90%+ test coverage for utility functions
- Zero memory leaks during normal operation
- Crash-free rate > 99.9%

### Acceptance Criteria
- Successfully builds and runs on both iOS and Android
- All PRD functional requirements implemented
- Passes app store review guidelines
- Offline sync accuracy > 95%

## Estimated Effort

### Overall Timeline: 6 weeks (single developer)

**Week 1**: Project foundation and basic navigation
**Week 2-3**: Core debt management features
**Week 4**: Offline functionality and sync
**Week 5**: Mobile-specific features (notifications, biometrics)
**Week 6**: Testing, polish, and app store submission

### Resource Requirements
- One React Native developer (learning curve included)
- iOS device for testing and development
- Android device for testing and development
- App store developer accounts

### Critical Path Items
1. Learning React Native and Expo ecosystem
2. Implementing robust offline sync logic
3. App store approval process timing
4. Backend API stability and availability

The simplified approach leverages Expo's managed workflow to minimize native development complexity while delivering a production-ready mobile app that meets all PRD requirements within an aggressive timeline.
