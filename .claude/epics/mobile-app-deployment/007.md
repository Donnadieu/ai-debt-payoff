# Task: AI Coaching System - LLM integration and content feed

## Description

Integrate AI coaching functionality with the FastAPI backend `/nudge/generate` endpoint to deliver personalized coaching content within the mobile app. Implement a content feed UI with safety validation, offline fallback content, and proper error handling for unreliable network conditions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Integration with FastAPI `/nudge/generate` endpoint
- [ ] AI coaching content feed UI component with scrollable timeline
- [ ] Content validation and safety checks for LLM-generated content
- [ ] Offline fallback content system with pre-loaded coaching tips
- [ ] Error handling for network failures and API rate limits
- [ ] Content caching and refresh mechanism
- [ ] Personalization based on user debt profile and progress
- [ ] Content categorization (motivational, educational, strategic tips)

## Technical Details

### React Native Implementation
- **Content Feed Component**: Scrollable FlatList with coaching content cards
- **API Integration**: Axios client with retry logic and timeout handling
- **Content Validation**: Client-side sanitization and safety filtering
- **Offline Storage**: SQLite caching of coaching content with expiry
- **UI Framework**: GluestackUI components for consistent styling

### Backend Integration
- **Primary Endpoint**: `/nudge/generate` for personalized coaching content
- **Request Parameters**: User debt data, progress metrics, behavioral context
- **Response Handling**: JSON parsing, error state management, content formatting
- **Rate Limiting**: Respectful API usage with exponential backoff

### Content Safety System
- **Content Filtering**: Remove harmful or inappropriate coaching advice
- **Validation Rules**: Ensure financial advice is general and not specific recommendations
- **Fallback Content**: Pre-approved coaching tips for offline/error scenarios
- **Content Reporting**: User feedback mechanism for inappropriate content

### Files to Create/Modify
- `src/components/CoachingFeed/CoachingFeed.tsx` - Main feed component
- `src/components/CoachingFeed/CoachingCard.tsx` - Individual content card
- `src/services/coaching.ts` - API integration service
- `src/utils/contentValidation.ts` - Content safety utilities
- `src/data/fallbackContent.ts` - Offline coaching content
- `src/hooks/useCoaching.ts` - React Query hook for coaching data
- `src/types/coaching.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for coaching data

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 005 completed (Authentication & Security foundation)
- [ ] FastAPI backend `/nudge/generate` endpoint operational
- [ ] GluestackUI component library configured
- [ ] SQLite database schema ready for content caching
- [ ] React Query configured for state management

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: L
- **Hours**: 26 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can work alongside other UI development)

### Breakdown
- API integration and service layer: 8 hours
- Content feed UI components: 10 hours  
- Safety validation and filtering: 4 hours
- Offline fallback system: 4 hours

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Coaching feed displays personalized content from FastAPI backend
- [ ] Content validation prevents inappropriate advice from displaying
- [ ] Offline mode shows pre-loaded fallback coaching tips
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully with user-friendly messages  
- [ ] Content caching works properly with refresh mechanism
- [ ] Feed performance is smooth with lazy loading for large content sets
- [ ] Unit tests cover API integration and content validation logic
- [ ] Integration tests verify end-to-end coaching flow
