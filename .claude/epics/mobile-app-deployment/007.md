# Task: API Client and Integration Layer

## Description

Set up a robust API client layer for seamless integration with the FastAPI backend. This includes Axios configuration with retry logic, comprehensive error handling, request/response interceptors, and a service layer that abstracts API calls for the mobile app.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Axios client configured with base URL and timeout settings
- [ ] Retry logic for failed requests with exponential backoff
- [ ] Request interceptors for authentication token injection
- [ ] Response interceptors for error handling and token refresh
- [ ] API service layer abstracting all backend endpoints
- [ ] Network error handling with user-friendly messages
- [ ] Offline queue management for failed requests
- [ ] Request cancellation for component unmounting
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces for all API request/response types
- [ ] Comprehensive error logging and debugging support

## Technical Details

- **HTTP Client**: Axios with interceptors and retry configuration
- **Error Handling**: Axios interceptors with custom error types
- **Retry Strategy**: Exponential backoff with jitter
- **Offline Support**: Queue failed requests for retry when online
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces matching FastAPI schemas
- **Debugging**: Request/response logging in development mode
- **Files to create**:
  - `src/services/api/client.ts` - Axios configuration and interceptors
  - `src/services/api/debts.ts` - Debt management API calls
  - `src/services/api/auth.ts` - Authentication API calls
  - `src/services/api/analytics.ts` - Analytics and tracking API calls
  - `src/types/api.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for API types
  - `src/utils/errorHandling.ts` - Error handling utilities
  - `src/hooks/useApi.ts` - React hook for API operations

## Dependencies

- [x] Backend API foundation available (Task 001)
- [ ] FastAPI backend running and accessible

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: M
- **Hours**: 16-20 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can develop alongside UI)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] API client configured and connects to FastAPI backend
- [ ] All backend endpoints accessible through service layer
- [ ] Retry logic handles temporary network failures gracefully
- [ ] Authentication tokens automatically injected and refreshed
- [ ] Error handling provides meaningful user feedback
- [ ] Offline requests queued and executed when connection restored
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety across API calls
- [ ] Request cancellation prevents memory leaks
- [ ] Comprehensive logging aids development and debugging
- [ ] Code follows project architecture and TypeScript patterns
