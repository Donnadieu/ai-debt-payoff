# Task: Testing & Quality Assurance

## Description

Implement comprehensive testing strategy for React Native mobile application including unit tests for business logic, component testing with React Native Testing Library, integration testing with backend APIs, and device testing on iOS and Android platforms.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Jest unit tests for all business logic functions
- [ ] React Native Testing Library tests for UI components
- [ ] Integration tests for FastAPI backend communication
- [ ] End-to-end testing scenarios for core user flows
- [ ] Device testing on iOS and Android (physical and simulators)
- [ ] Performance testing and memory leak detection
- [ ] Offline functionality testing with network simulation
- [ ] Accessibility testing with screen readers
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage for core business logic
- [ ] All tests passing in CI/CD pipeline

## Technical Details

- **Testing Framework**: Jest for unit tests with React Native preset
- **Component Testing**: React Native Testing Library for UI interactions
- **API Testing**: MSW (Mock Service Worker) for backend integration tests
- **Device Testing**: iOS Simulator, Android Emulator, and physical devices
- **Performance**: Flipper integration for performance profiling
- **E2E Testing**: Detox for automated end-to-end scenarios
- **Files to create**:
  - `__tests__/` directory structure for organized test files
  - `components/__tests__/` - Component unit tests
  - `services/__tests__/` - API service integration tests
  - `utils/__tests__/` - Business logic utility tests
  - `e2e/` - End-to-end test scenarios
  - `jest.config.js` - Jest configuration for React Native
  - `.detoxrc.js` - Detox configuration for E2E tests

## Testing Scenarios

### Core User Flows
- User registration and authentication
- Debt input and validation
- Payoff plan generation (Snowball vs Avalanche)
- Progress tracking and payment logging
- AI coaching nudge display
- Offline sync functionality

### Edge Cases
- Network connectivity loss during API calls
- Invalid debt input data validation
- App backgrounding and foregrounding
- Memory pressure scenarios
- Device rotation and screen size adaptation

### Performance Benchmarks
- App startup time < 3 seconds
- Navigation transitions at 60fps
- API response handling < 2 seconds
- Memory usage under normal operation limits
- Battery usage optimization validation

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 006 - Debt Management Core (business logic implementation)
- [ ] Task 007 - Progress Dashboard (UI components and calculations)
- [ ] Task 008 - AI Coaching Integration (LLM content handling)
- [ ] FastAPI backend endpoints available for integration testing
- [ ] iOS and Android development environments setup

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: L
- **Hours**: 28 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can run alongside other development tasks)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All unit tests passing with 90%+ coverage
- [ ] Component tests validate UI interactions correctly
- [ ] Integration tests confirm backend API communication
- [ ] Device testing completed on iOS and Android
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet acceptance criteria
- [ ] Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) validated
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs all tests automatically
- [ ] Test documentation and maintenance guides created
