# Task: SQLite Database Setup

## Description

Configure react-native-sqlite-storage for offline data persistence in the mobile app. Create a comprehensive database schema that mirrors the FastAPI backend models and implement a robust migration system for schema updates. This provides the foundation for offline-first functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] react-native-sqlite-storage configured and initialized
- [ ] Database schema created for all debt-related entities
- [ ] Migration system implemented with version control
- [ ] Database helper functions for CRUD operations
- [ ] Error handling for database operations
- [ ] Database initialization on app first launch
- [ ] Schema validation and integrity constraints
- [ ] Performance optimization with indexes

## Technical Details

- **Library**: react-native-sqlite-storage for robust SQLite support
- **Schema Design**: Mirror FastAPI backend models (Debt, User, Payment, etc.)
- **Migration Strategy**: Versioned migrations with rollback capability
- **Performance**: Indexes on frequently queried fields
- **Files to create**:
  - `src/database/sqlite.ts` - SQLite configuration and connection
  - `src/database/migrations/` - Migration files directory
  - `src/database/models/` - TypeScript interfaces for database models
  - `src/database/helpers.ts` - CRUD operation helpers
  - `src/database/init.ts` - Database initialization logic

## Dependencies

- [x] Task 001: Project Setup and Configuration (for React Native foundation)
- [ ] NPM packages: react-native-sqlite-storage

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: M
- **Hours**: 16-20 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can work alongside other features)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] SQLite database successfully initializes on app startup
- [ ] All required tables created with proper schema
- [ ] Migration system tested with schema updates
- [ ] CRUD operations working for all entities
- [ ] Error handling covers database connection failures
- [ ] Database queries optimized with appropriate indexes
- [ ] TypeScript types defined for all database models
- [ ] Unit tests written for database operations
