## Description

Implement Firebase Authentication for secure user management in the mobile app. This includes user registration, login, session management, and secure token storage with proper error handling and user experience flows.

## MVP Scope

Implementing authentication for 3 core features:
1. **Debt Tracking** - Secure user-specific debt data
2. **Payment Strategy** - Personalized strategy preferences
3. **Progress Visualization** - User's individual progress data

## Technical Requirements

### Firebase Configuration
- Set up Firebase project for the mobile app
- Configure Firebase Auth with email/password provider
- Install and configure Firebase SDK for React Native/Expo
- Set up Firebase configuration files and environment variables

### Authentication Flows
- Email/password registration with validation
- Email/password login with proper error handling
- Password reset functionality via email
- Email verification for new accounts
- Secure logout with token cleanup

### User Session Management
- Persistent authentication state using AsyncStorage
- Automatic token refresh handling
- Session expiration detection and re-authentication
- Biometric authentication support (optional enhancement)

### Security Implementation
- Secure token storage using Expo SecureStore
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for authentication attempts
- Proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can register with email/password successfully
- [ ] Users can log in with valid credentials
- [ ] Users can reset forgotten passwords via email
- [ ] Authentication state persists across app restarts
- [ ] Users can log out and clear session data
- [ ] Email verification works for new registrations
- [ ] Proper error messages display for authentication failures
- [ ] Authentication screens integrate with app navigation
- [ ] Tokens are stored securely using Expo SecureStore
- [ ] Authentication guards protect authenticated routes

## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Context
```typescript
interface AuthContextType {
  user: User | null;
  isLoading: boolean;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  signIn: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
  signUp: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
  signOut: () => Promise<void>;
  resetPassword: (email: string) => Promise<void>;
}
```

### Screen Structure
```
src/screens/auth/
├── LoginScreen.tsx
├── RegisterScreen.tsx
├── ResetPasswordScreen.tsx
└── EmailVerificationScreen.tsx
```

### Security Features
- Form validation with proper error feedback
- Loading states during authentication operations
- Secure credential storage
- Auto-logout on token expiration

### Navigation Integration
- Authentication stack for login flows
- Protected routes requiring authentication
- Automatic navigation based on auth state
- Deep linking support for password reset

## Dependencies
- Task 001 (Foundation Setup) must be completed first
- Firebase project setup and configuration
- Expo SecureStore for secure token storage

## Estimated Effort
20 hours total:
- Firebase setup and configuration: 4 hours
- Authentication flow implementation: 8 hours
- Session management and security: 6 hours
- Testing and error handling: 2 hours

## Optional Enhancements
If time permits after core implementation:
- Google Sign-In integration
- Apple Sign-In (for iOS)
- Biometric authentication
- Multi-factor authentication

## Notes
- Firebase Auth provides robust security features out of the box
- Focus on user experience with clear error messages and loading states
- Ensure proper cleanup of authentication state on logout
- Consider offline authentication state management
- Email/password is the primary authentication method for MVP
- Google Sign-In can be added as enhancement if core auth is stable

## Security Considerations
- Never store passwords in plain text or local storage
- Use secure storage for authentication tokens
- Implement proper session timeout handling
- Validate all inputs before sending to Firebase
- Handle network errors gracefully
- Log security events for monitoring
