Package Name	Supported Versions	Upcoming Support
next	13 <= versions <= 15	-
react-native	versions >= 72.5	-
expo	versions >= 50	-
node	versions > 16	-
Step 2: Initialize
Go to your project, and use the init command at the root of your project to add GluestackUIProvider and essential components (icon, overlay, toast) to your project.
npx gluestack-ui init

Your project is now ready to use gluestack-ui components. To add gluestack-ui components to your project using the CLI, refer to the above command or use the CLI guide.

Common issues
Expo app stuck in tailwindcss(ios) rebuilding... while running expo start command
In this case, you may have your app stored in a directory with a name containing spaces, such as 'Expo App', renaming it to just 'Expo-App' will resolve the issue.
