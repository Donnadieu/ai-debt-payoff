# Task: EAS Build Configuration

## Description

Set up EAS Build infrastructure for iOS and Android app compilation. Configure build profiles for development, staging, and production environments with proper app signing, environment variables, and secrets management for app store distribution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] EAS CLI installed and configured
- [ ] app.json/app.config.js configured for build settings
- [ ] Build profiles created for dev/staging/production
- [ ] iOS code signing certificates configured
- [ ] Android keystore and signing configured
- [ ] Environment variables and secrets management
- [ ] Build triggers and automation setup
- [ ] Build artifact management and distribution

## Technical Details

- **Build Service**: Expo EAS Build for cloud compilation
- **Profiles**: Separate configurations for each environment
- **Signing**: Automatic certificate management where possible
- **Secrets**: EAS Secrets for sensitive environment variables
- **Files to create/modify**:
  - `eas.json` - Build configuration profiles
  - `app.config.js` - Dynamic app configuration
  - `.env.example` - Environment variable template
  - `scripts/build.sh` - Build automation script
  - `docs/deployment.md` - Build and deployment documentation

## Dependencies

- [x] Task 001: Project Setup and Configuration (for Expo foundation)
- [ ] Apple Developer Program membership
- [ ] Google Play Console account
- [ ] EAS account and billing setup

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: M
- **Hours**: 16-20 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can prepare alongside development)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] EAS Build successfully compiles iOS and Android apps
- [ ] All build profiles (dev/staging/production) working
- [ ] Code signing certificates properly configured
- [ ] Environment variables securely managed
- [ ] Build process documented and automated
- [ ] Test builds installable on physical devices
- [ ] Build logs accessible for debugging
- [ ] Continuous integration potential established
