# Task: Biometric Authentication Setup

## Description

Implement biometric authentication capabilities (Face ID, TouchID, Fingerprint) as an additional security layer for the mobile app. This includes device capability detection, biometric setup flow, fallback authentication methods, and security best practices implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Biometric capability detection (Face ID, TouchID, Fingerprint)
- [ ] Biometric enrollment/setup flow for new users
- [ ] Biometric authentication for app access
- [ ] Fallback to password authentication when biometric fails
- [ ] Settings screen for enabling/disabling biometric auth
- [ ] Proper error handling for biometric failures and unavailability
- [ ] Security best practices (no biometric data storage)
- [ ] Graceful degradation on devices without biometric support
- [ ] User education about biometric security benefits

## Technical Details

- **Biometric Library**: react-native-biometrics or Expo LocalAuthentication
- **Capability Detection**: Check device biometric hardware availability
- **Security Model**: Biometric triggers token retrieval, no biometric data stored
- **Fallback Strategy**: Password prompt when biometric unavailable/fails
- **Settings Integration**: Toggle in user preferences
- **Files to create**:
  - `src/services/biometrics.ts` - Biometric authentication service
  - `src/hooks/useBiometrics.ts` - Biometric authentication hook
  - `src/screens/BiometricSetupScreen.tsx` - Biometric setup flow
  - `src/components/BiometricPrompt.tsx` - Biometric authentication prompt
  - `src/utils/deviceCapabilities.ts` - Device capability detection
  - `src/screens/settings/BiometricSettingsScreen.tsx` - Settings management

## Dependencies

- [x] Authentication system implementation (Task 004)
- [ ] Device testing capabilities for biometric hardware

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: M
- **Hours**: 16-20 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can work alongside other auth features)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented and tested on devices with biometric hardware
- [ ] Biometric setup flow guides users through enrollment
- [ ] Authentication works with Face ID, TouchID, and Fingerprint
- [ ] Fallback authentication functions correctly
- [ ] Settings allow users to control biometric preferences
- [ ] Error handling covers all failure scenarios
- [ ] Security audit confirms no biometric data storage
- [ ] User experience is intuitive and educational
- [ ] Code follows project security and TypeScript patterns
