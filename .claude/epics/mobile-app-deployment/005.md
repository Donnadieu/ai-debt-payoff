# Task 005: Backend API Integration - FastAPI Connection and Payoff Calculations

## Overview

Integrate React Native mobile app with existing FastAPI backend services, establishing secure API communication for debt payoff calculations and data synchronization. Implement offline-first architecture with retry logic and queue management to ensure reliable functionality regardless of network conditions.

## Technical Scope

### Core API Integration
- **Axios HTTP Client Setup**: Configure base client with interceptors, timeout handling, and authentication headers
- **FastAPI Endpoint Integration**: Connect to existing `/plan` endpoint for Snowball/Avalanche debt payoff calculations
- **Request/Response Validation**: TypeScript interfaces matching backend Pydantic models
- **Error Handling Strategy**: Comprehensive error classification and user-friendly messaging

### Offline-First Architecture
- **Request Queuing System**: SQLite-backed queue for API requests when offline
- **Response Caching**: Strategic caching of calculation results and user data
- **Sync Management**: Background synchronization when network connectivity restored
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle data conflicts between local and server state

### Authentication & Security
- **Token Management**: Secure storage and refresh of JWT tokens
- **Request Signing**: HMAC-based request authentication for sensitive operations
- **Certificate Pinning**: SSL pinning for production API endpoints
- **Data Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive financial data

## Implementation Details

### API Client Architecture
```typescript
// Core API client with retry logic and offline queue
class ApiClient {
  private axiosInstance: AxiosInstance;
  private offlineQueue: RequestQueue;
  private cacheManager: ResponseCache;
  
  // Authentication, retry logic, request/response interceptors
  // Offline queue management and background sync
}
```

### Key Integrations
1. **Debt Plan Generation**: `/api/plan` endpoint for payoff strategies
2. **User Data Sync**: `/api/user/sync` for cross-device data consistency
3. **Payment Tracking**: `/api/payments` for payment history and progress
4. **Analytics Events**: `/api/events` for user behavior tracking

### Error Handling Categories
- **Network Errors**: Retry with exponential backoff, queue for offline processing
- **Authentication Errors**: Token refresh, re-authentication flow
- **Validation Errors**: User-friendly field-level error messages
- **Server Errors**: Graceful degradation with cached fallback data

### Performance Optimizations
- **Request Debouncing**: Prevent duplicate API calls during user input
- **Response Compression**: GZIP compression for large calculation responses
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse HTTP connections for multiple requests
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking API calls with loading states

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Users can generate debt payoff plans using Snowball and Avalanche strategies
- [ ] API calls work seamlessly in online and offline modes
- [ ] Payment data syncs reliably across devices
- [ ] Error messages provide actionable guidance to users
- [ ] Background sync occurs automatically when network restored

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] All API responses cached appropriately with TTL management
- [ ] Request queue persists through app restarts and crashes
- [ ] Authentication tokens refresh automatically before expiration
- [ ] API client handles rate limiting with proper backoff
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces match backend models exactly

### Performance Standards
- [ ] API response times under 2 seconds for plan generation
- [ ] Offline queue processes requests within 10 seconds of connectivity
- [ ] Cache hit ratio above 80% for repeated calculations
- [ ] Memory usage under 50MB for API client and cache combined
- [ ] Battery impact minimal during background sync operations

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- **Task 003**: UI Foundation must be complete for API integration points
- **FastAPI Backend**: Stable `/plan` endpoint with documented API schema
- **Authentication System**: JWT token management and refresh endpoints
- **Database Schema**: SQLite tables for offline queue and cache storage

### External Services
- **Network Connectivity**: React Native NetInfo for connection monitoring
- **Secure Storage**: Expo SecureStore for token and sensitive data storage
- **Background Tasks**: Expo TaskManager for offline sync processing
- **Crypto Operations**: Expo Crypto for encryption and HMAC signing

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- API client methods with mocked network responses
- Offline queue operations and data persistence
- Error handling for all failure scenarios
- Token refresh and authentication flows

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end API communication with test backend
- Offline-to-online sync scenarios with real network conditions
- Cross-device data consistency with multiple app instances
- Performance testing under various network conditions

### Manual Testing
- Complete debt input and plan generation workflow
- Network interruption during API calls
- App backgrounding during sync operations
- Error recovery and user notification scenarios
