# Task: Offline Sync Logic Implementation

## Description

Build a comprehensive sync service that manages data synchronization between local SQLite database and the FastAPI backend. Implement offline queue management for API calls and robust conflict resolution to ensure data consistency across online and offline states.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Bidirectional sync service between SQLite and FastAPI
- [ ] Offline queue for storing API calls when disconnected
- [ ] Conflict resolution strategy for data inconsistencies
- [ ] Network state detection and automatic sync triggers
- [ ] Incremental sync to minimize data transfer
- [ ] Retry logic with exponential backoff for failed syncs
- [ ] Data integrity validation after sync operations
- [ ] Background sync scheduling and optimization

## Technical Details

- **Sync Strategy**: Last-write-wins with conflict detection
- **Queue Management**: Persistent queue for offline API calls
- **Network Detection**: React Native NetInfo for connectivity status
- **Conflict Resolution**: User-prompted resolution for critical conflicts
- **Files to create**:
  - `src/services/syncService.ts` - Core sync orchestration
  - `src/services/offlineQueue.ts` - Offline API call queue management
  - `src/services/conflictResolver.ts` - Data conflict resolution logic
  - `src/hooks/useSync.ts` - React hooks for sync operations
  - `src/utils/networkUtils.ts` - Network connectivity utilities

## Dependencies

- [x] Task 007: API Integration and HTTP Client (for backend communication)
- [x] Task 009: SQLite Database Setup (for local data storage)
- [ ] NPM packages: @react-native-netinfo/netinfo

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: XL
- **Hours**: 24+ hours
- **Parallel**: false (needs both database and API client)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Sync service handles online/offline state changes
- [ ] Offline queue persists API calls and executes when online
- [ ] Conflict resolution prompts user when needed
- [ ] Incremental sync reduces bandwidth usage
- [ ] Background sync runs without blocking UI
- [ ] Data integrity maintained across sync operations
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling for sync failures
- [ ] Performance optimized for large datasets
