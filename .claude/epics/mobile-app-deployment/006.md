# Task: Core UI Components Library

## Description

Build a comprehensive library of reusable UI components specifically designed for debt management functionality. This includes form components with validation, charts and progress visualization components, and debt-specific UI elements that will be used throughout the mobile app.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Reusable form components (Input, Select, Button, FormField)
- [ ] Form validation components with error display
- [ ] Debt management specific components (DebtCard, PaymentEntry)
- [ ] Charts and progress visualization components
- [ ] Loading states and skeleton components
- [ ] Success/error feedback components
- [ ] Navigation and layout components
- [ ] Accessible components following WCAG guidelines
- [ ] Consistent design system based on GluestackUI v3
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces for all component props
- [ ] Storybook documentation for component library

## Technical Details

- **UI Framework**: GluestackUI v3 as base design system
- **Charts**: react-native-chart-kit or Victory Native for visualizations
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form integration
- **Validation**: Yup schema validation
- **Accessibility**: React Native accessibility props
- **Testing**: React Native Testing Library for component tests
- **Files to create**:
  - `src/components/forms/` - Form component library
  - `src/components/debt/` - Debt-specific UI components  
  - `src/components/charts/` - Chart and visualization components
  - `src/components/feedback/` - Loading, success, error components
  - `src/components/navigation/` - Navigation-specific components
  - `src/types/components.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for props
  - `src/styles/theme.ts` - Theme configuration and constants

## Dependencies

- [x] Navigation foundation (Task 002)
- [ ] GluestackUI v3 setup and configuration
- [ ] Chart library selection and setup

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: L
- **Hours**: 20-24 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can work alongside other UI development)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Component library implemented with consistent design patterns
- [ ] All components fully typed with TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Form components integrate with React Hook Form and validation
- [ ] Chart components display debt progress and payment strategies
- [ ] Loading states and feedback components enhance user experience
- [ ] Accessibility features implemented and tested
- [ ] Component tests written for critical functionality
- [ ] Storybook documentation available for development reference
- [ ] Code follows project React Native and TypeScript patterns
