# Task 006: Progress Dashboard - Visual Progress Tracking and Metrics

## Overview

Build comprehensive progress dashboard providing visual debt payoff tracking, key financial metrics, and motivational milestone celebrations. Implement real-time progress indicators, payment history, and achievement system to maintain user engagement throughout their debt freedom journey.

## Technical Scope

### Core Dashboard Components
- **Progress Visualization**: Animated progress bars, countdown timers, and debt reduction charts
- **Key Metrics Display**: Total debt remaining, interest saved, projected payoff date, monthly progress
- **Payment Logging System**: Manual payment entry with validation and confirmation
- **History Tracking**: Chronological payment history with filtering and search capabilities
- **Achievement System**: Milestone celebrations, badges, and motivational content

### Visual Components (GluestackUI)
- **Progress Indicators**: Circular and linear progress bars with smooth animations
- **Data Charts**: Simple bar and line charts for trend visualization
- **Metric Cards**: Clean card layouts for key financial statistics
- **Timeline Components**: Payment history with interactive timeline interface
- **Modal Dialogs**: Payment logging and milestone celebration overlays

### Data Management
- **Local Storage**: SQLite persistence for payment history and progress snapshots
- **Real-time Calculations**: Dynamic debt balances and payoff projections
- **Data Aggregation**: Monthly, quarterly, and yearly progress summaries
- **Sync Integration**: Coordinate with API client for cross-device data consistency

## Implementation Details

### Dashboard Layout Structure
```typescript
// Main dashboard with tabbed sections
interface DashboardScreens {
  Overview: ProgressOverview;      // High-level metrics and current status
  Timeline: PaymentTimeline;       // Detailed payment history
  Insights: ProgressInsights;      // Trends and recommendations
  Achievements: MilestoneTracker;  // Badges and celebrations
}
```

### Progress Calculation Engine
- **Debt Balance Tracking**: Real-time balance calculations based on payment history
- **Interest Savings**: Cumulative interest saved compared to minimum payments
- **Payoff Projections**: Dynamic timeline updates based on actual payment patterns
- **Velocity Metrics**: Payment frequency and acceleration indicators

### Visual Design Patterns
- **Dark Theme Optimized**: High contrast colors and accessibility-friendly design
- **Animation Framework**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions using React Native Reanimated
- **Responsive Layout**: Adaptive design for different screen sizes and orientations
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens and progressive loading for smooth UX

### Payment Logging Workflow
1. **Manual Entry**: Simple form with amount, date, and debt selection
2. **Validation**: Amount validation against debt balances and reasonable ranges
3. **Confirmation**: Review screen with impact preview before saving
4. **Processing**: Local storage update and background API sync
5. **Feedback**: Success animation and updated progress visualization

## Acceptance Criteria

### Dashboard Functionality
- [ ] Users can view total debt remaining and payoff timeline at a glance
- [ ] Progress bars accurately reflect current debt reduction percentage
- [ ] Payment logging works offline with background sync when online
- [ ] Payment history displays chronologically with filtering options
- [ ] Achievement milestones trigger automatically based on progress

### Visual Requirements
- [ ] All animations smooth and performant on mid-range devices
- [ ] Dashboard loads under 2 seconds with skeleton loading states
- [ ] Progress indicators update in real-time when payments logged
- [ ] Charts and graphs display clearly on both light and dark themes
- [ ] Accessibility standards met with proper contrast and text sizing

### Data Accuracy
- [ ] All debt calculations match backend API results exactly
- [ ] Payment history persists correctly through app restarts
- [ ] Progress metrics reflect real payment patterns and projections
- [ ] Cross-device data sync maintains consistency without conflicts
- [ ] Interest savings calculations verified against financial formulas

### User Experience
- [ ] Dashboard provides motivational feedback and positive reinforcement
- [ ] Payment logging process completes in under 30 seconds
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully with actionable recovery options
- [ ] Milestone celebrations feel rewarding without being intrusive
- [ ] Navigation between dashboard sections feels intuitive and responsive

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- **Task 004**: Debt Management screens for data input and debt list integration
- **Task 005**: Backend API integration for payment sync and calculation validation
- **SQLite Schema**: Database tables for payment history and progress snapshots
- **GluestackUI Components**: Progress bars, charts, cards, and modal components

### Data Dependencies
- **Debt Data**: User's debt list with current balances and payment terms
- **Payment History**: Complete log of all payments made through the app
- **Plan Calculations**: Snowball/Avalanche payoff schedules from backend API
- **User Preferences**: Display settings, achievement preferences, notification settings

## Performance Considerations

### Rendering Optimization
- **Memoization**: React.memo and useMemo for expensive calculations and components
- **Lazy Loading**: Progressive loading of historical data and chart components
- **Animation Performance**: 60fps animations using native driver and Reanimated
- **Memory Management**: Efficient cleanup of event listeners and timers

### Data Processing
- **Calculation Caching**: Cache expensive interest and timeline calculations
- **Batch Updates**: Group multiple payment updates for efficient database writes
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking calculations using web workers where possible
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without animations/charts

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Progress calculation algorithms with various debt scenarios
- Payment logging validation and error handling
- Achievement trigger logic and milestone detection
- Chart data transformation and formatting functions

### Integration Tests
- Dashboard data flow from SQLite to UI components
- Payment logging end-to-end with API sync verification
- Cross-screen navigation and state persistence
- Offline/online sync scenarios with data consistency checks

### Visual Testing
- Screenshot tests for key dashboard states and themes
- Animation performance testing on various device specifications
- Accessibility testing with screen readers and navigation
- Responsive design testing across phone and tablet form factors
