# Task: Project Setup and Initialization

## Description

Initialize the React Native project with Expo, configure TypeScript and development environment, and set up the basic project structure and dependencies. This task establishes the foundation for the mobile debt payoff application with proper development tooling and project architecture.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React Native project initialized with Expo CLI
- [ ] TypeScript configuration set up and working
- [ ] Basic project structure created with proper folder organization
- [ ] Essential dependencies installed (navigation, UI library, state management)
- [ ] Development environment configured and tested
- [ ] Expo development server running successfully
- [ ] Basic App.tsx with TypeScript working
- [ ] Package.json scripts configured for development workflow

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: React Native with Expo SDK 49+
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict configuration
- **Package Manager**: npm or yarn
- **Development Server**: Expo CLI with metro bundler
- **Files to create**:
  - `App.tsx` - Main application component
  - `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
  - `app.json` - Expo configuration
  - `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
  - `src/` folder structure for organized codebase
  - `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules for React Native/Expo

## Dependencies

- [ ] Node.js 16+ environment
- [ ] Expo CLI globally installed
- [ ] No task dependencies (foundation task)

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: M
- **Hours**: 16-20 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can run alongside other setup tasks)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Project created and building without errors
- [ ] TypeScript compilation working correctly
- [ ] Expo development server starts successfully
- [ ] Basic app renders on simulator/device
- [ ] All dependencies installed and compatible
- [ ] Project structure documented and organized
- [ ] Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore
- [ ] Development workflow scripts functional
