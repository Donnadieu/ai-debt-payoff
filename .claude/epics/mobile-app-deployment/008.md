# Task: Monetization Features - Subscription paywall and premium gating

## Description

Implement subscription-based monetization with paywall screens, premium feature gating, and payment processing integration. Create a seamless billing experience that converts users while providing clear value differentiation between free and premium tiers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Subscription paywall implementation with pricing tiers
- [ ] Premium feature gating logic throughout the app
- [ ] Payment processing integration (iOS/Android in-app purchases)
- [ ] Billing cycle and pricing tier management
- [ ] Subscription status tracking and synchronization
- [ ] Graceful free tier limitations and upgrade prompts
- [ ] Payment success/failure handling and user feedback
- [ ] Subscription management interface for users

## Technical Details

### React Native Implementation
- **Paywall Component**: Modal screens with subscription offerings and pricing
- **Feature Gating**: Higher-order components and hooks for premium access control
- **Payment Integration**: React Native IAP library for App Store and Google Play
- **Subscription State**: Zustand store for subscription status management
- **UI Components**: GluestackUI styled pricing cards and upgrade prompts

### Subscription Architecture
- **Free Tier Limits**: Basic debt tracking (3 debts max), standard payoff plan
- **Premium Features**: Unlimited debts, advanced analytics, AI coaching, custom strategies
- **Pricing Strategy**: Monthly ($4.99) and Annual ($49.99) subscription options
- **Trial Period**: 7-day free trial for new premium subscribers

### Payment Processing
- **iOS Integration**: App Store Connect and StoreKit for iPhone/iPad purchases
- **Android Integration**: Google Play Billing for Android device purchases
- **Receipt Validation**: Server-side validation of purchase receipts
- **Restoration**: Purchase restoration across devices for existing subscribers
