# Task: Core Debt Management Screens

## Description

Implement the primary debt management screens that form the core functionality of the mobile app. This includes debt CRUD operations, payment tracking and entry forms, and a comprehensive dashboard with debt overview and progress visualization.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dashboard screen with debt overview and progress charts
- [ ] Add/Edit debt screens with comprehensive form validation
- [ ] Debt list screen with search, sort, and filter capabilities
- [ ] Payment entry form with quick payment options
- [ ] Payment history screen with transaction details
- [ ] Debt detail screen showing payment schedule and progress
- [ ] Delete confirmation dialogs with proper safeguards
- [ ] Real-time progress updates reflecting payment entries
- [ ] Navigation between all debt management screens
- [ ] Offline functionality with local data persistence

## Technical Details

- **Screen Architecture**: Stack navigator with proper prop passing
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, local state for UI
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form with yup validation schemas  
- **Data Visualization**: Charts showing debt reduction progress
- **Local Storage**: SQLite for offline data persistence
- **Real-time Updates**: Optimistic UI updates with server sync
- **Files to create**:
  - `src/screens/debt/DashboardScreen.tsx` - Main debt overview
  - `src/screens/debt/AddDebtScreen.tsx` - New debt creation form
  - `src/screens/debt/EditDebtScreen.tsx` - Debt modification form
  - `src/screens/debt/DebtListScreen.tsx` - All debts list view
  - `src/screens/debt/DebtDetailScreen.tsx` - Individual debt details

  - `src/screens/payment/PaymentHistoryScreen.tsx` - Payment transaction history
