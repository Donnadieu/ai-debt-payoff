# Task: Background Sync and App State Management

## Description

Implement background app refresh capabilities and intelligent app state management to handle foreground/background transitions. Optimize sync timing and battery usage while ensuring data stays current when users return to the app.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Background app refresh configured for iOS and Android
- [ ] App state change detection (foreground/background)
- [ ] Intelligent sync scheduling based on app usage patterns
- [ ] Battery usage optimization with sync intervals
- [ ] Background task management and cleanup
- [ ] App lifecycle hooks integrated with sync service
- [ ] Wake lock management for critical sync operations
- [ ] Background sync status indicators in UI

## Technical Details

- **Background Tasks**: Expo TaskManager for background execution
- **App State**: React Native AppState API for lifecycle detection
- **Optimization**: Adaptive sync intervals based on usage and battery
- **Task Management**: Proper cleanup of background tasks
- **Files to create**:
  - `src/services/backgroundSync.ts` - Background sync orchestration
  - `src/hooks/useAppState.ts` - App state change hooks
  - `src/utils/batteryOptimizer.ts` - Battery usage optimization
  - `src/services/taskManager.ts` - Background task lifecycle management
  - `src/components/SyncStatusIndicator.tsx` - UI sync status component

## Dependencies

- [x] Task 010: Offline Sync Logic Implementation (for sync foundation)
- [ ] NPM packages: expo-task-manager, expo-background-fetch

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: L
- **Hours**: 20-24 hours
- **Parallel**: false (needs offline sync foundation)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Background sync runs when app is backgrounded
- [ ] App state changes trigger appropriate sync actions
- [ ] Battery usage optimized with smart scheduling
- [ ] Background tasks properly registered and cleaned up
- [ ] Sync status visible to users in UI
- [ ] Critical syncs use wake locks appropriately
- [ ] Background refresh settings respect user preferences
- [ ] Performance impact minimized on app startup
