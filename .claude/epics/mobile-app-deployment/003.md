# Task: Development Environment and Tools

## Description

Configure development tools including ESLint, Prettier, VS Code settings, set up testing framework with Jest and React Native Testing Library, and configure error boundaries and logging for robust development workflow and debugging capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] ESLint configured with React Native and TypeScript rules
- [ ] Prettier configured for consistent code formatting
- [ ] VS Code settings and extensions recommendations added
- [ ] Jest testing framework configured for React Native
- [ ] React Native Testing Library set up for component testing
- [ ] Error boundaries implemented for crash handling
- [ ] Logging system configured for debugging
- [ ] Git hooks set up for code quality (pre-commit)

## Technical Details

- **Linting**: ESLint with @react-native-community/eslint-config
- **Formatting**: Prettier with React Native presets
- **Testing**: Jest + React Native Testing Library
- **Error Handling**: React error boundaries with crash reporting
- **Logging**: Custom logging service with different levels
- **Files to create**:
  - `.eslintrc.js` - ESLint configuration
  - `.prettierrc` - Prettier configuration
  - `.vscode/settings.json` - VS Code workspace settings
  - `.vscode/extensions.json` - Recommended extensions
  - `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - Error boundary component
  - `src/services/logger.ts` - Logging service
  - `src/utils/crashlytics.ts` - Crash reporting setup
  - `__tests__/` - Test setup and sample tests

## Dependencies

- [x] Task 001: Project Setup and Initialization must be completed
- [ ] Development tool packages (ESLint, Prettier, Jest)
- [ ] Testing library packages

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: S
- **Hours**: 8-12 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can run alongside UI work)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code linting working with proper rules
- [ ] Automatic code formatting on save
- [ ] VS Code workspace configured optimally
- [ ] Test suite running successfully with sample tests
- [ ] Error boundaries catching and logging crashes
- [ ] Logging system functional with different levels
- [ ] Git hooks enforcing code quality
- [ ] All development tools integrated and documented
