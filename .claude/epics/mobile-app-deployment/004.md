# Task: Authentication System Implementation

## Description

Implement a comprehensive Firebase Authentication system with secure token management for the mobile app. This includes login/register screens with Firebase Auth, Google Sign-In integration, secure token storage, and authentication state management. Firebase provides rapid development with built-in security features.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Firebase Authentication SDK integration and configuration
- [ ] Email/password authentication with Firebase Auth
- [ ] Google Sign-In integration for social authentication
- [ ] User registration screen with Firebase Auth and validation
- [ ] Secure token storage using react-native-keychain for biometric caching
- [ ] Firebase Auth state management with Context API
- [ ] Password reset functionality via Firebase Auth
- [ ] Proper error handling for Firebase auth errors and network failures
- [ ] Loading states and user feedback during auth operations
- [ ] Authentication state persistence across app restarts via Firebase

## Technical Details

- **Authentication Provider**: Firebase Authentication
- **Auth Methods**: Email/password, Google Sign-In
- **Secure Storage**: react-native-keychain for biometric token caching
- **State Management**: Firebase Auth state listener with Context API
- **Form Validation**: React Hook Form with yup schema validation
- **Firebase Features**: Automatic token refresh, email verification, password reset
- **Files to create**:
  - `src/config/firebase.ts` - Firebase configuration and initialization
  - `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Firebase Auth state management
  - `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Firebase Auth hook with biometric integration
  - `src/screens/LoginScreen.tsx` - Login form with Firebase Auth
  - `src/screens/RegisterScreen.tsx` - Registration with Firebase Auth
  - `src/services/firebaseAuth.ts` - Firebase Auth wrapper service
  - `src/utils/secureStorage.ts` - Secure storage utilities for biometric tokens

## Dependencies

- [x] Navigation foundation (Task 002)
- [ ] Firebase project setup with Authentication enabled
- [ ] Firebase SDK packages: @react-native-firebase/app, @react-native-firebase/auth
- [ ] Google Sign-In package: @react-native-google-signin/google-signin
- [ ] Firebase configuration files (google-services.json, GoogleService-Info.plist)
- [ ] react-native-keychain configured

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: L
- **Hours**: 20-24 hours
- **Parallel**: false (needs navigation foundation)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented and tested on both iOS and Android
- [ ] Firebase Authentication flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Email/password authentication working via Firebase Auth
- [ ] Google Sign-In working on both platforms
- [ ] Firebase tokens cached securely for biometric authentication
- [ ] Authentication state persists across app restarts via Firebase
- [ ] Password reset emails sent via Firebase Auth
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully with Firebase-specific error messages
- [ ] Loading states implemented for all Firebase auth operations
- [ ] Form validation working with clear error messages
- [ ] Firebase Auth state changes properly handled in the app
- [ ] Code follows project TypeScript and React patterns
