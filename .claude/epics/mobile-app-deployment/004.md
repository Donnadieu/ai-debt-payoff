# Task: Authentication System Implementation

## Description

Implement a comprehensive OAuth 2.0 authentication system with secure token management for the mobile app. This includes login/register screens, secure token storage using react-native-keychain, and authentication state management that integrates with the existing FastAPI backend.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] OAuth 2.0 login screen with email/password validation
- [ ] User registration screen with form validation and error handling
- [ ] Secure token storage implementation using react-native-keychain
- [ ] Authentication state management (login/logout/token refresh)
- [ ] Integration with FastAPI backend auth endpoints
- [ ] Proper error handling for network failures and invalid credentials
- [ ] Loading states and user feedback during auth operations
- [ ] Automatic token refresh before expiration
- [ ] Session persistence across app restarts

## Technical Details

- **Authentication Flow**: OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens
- **Secure Storage**: react-native-keychain for token storage
- **State Management**: Context API with useAuth hook
- **Backend Integration**: FastAPI /auth endpoints
- **Form Validation**: React Hook Form with yup schema validation
- **Files to create**:
  - `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Authentication state management
  - `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Authentication hook
  - `src/screens/LoginScreen.tsx` - Login form screen
  - `src/screens/RegisterScreen.tsx` - Registration form screen
  - `src/services/auth.ts` - Authentication API service
  - `src/utils/secureStorage.ts` - Token storage utilities

## Dependencies

- [x] Navigation foundation (Task 002)
- [ ] FastAPI backend auth endpoints available
- [ ] react-native-keychain configured

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: L
- **Hours**: 20-24 hours
- **Parallel**: false (needs navigation foundation)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented and tested on both iOS and Android
- [ ] Authentication flow works end-to-end with backend
- [ ] Tokens stored securely and persist across app sessions
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully with user feedback
- [ ] Loading states implemented for all async operations
- [ ] Form validation working with clear error messages
- [ ] Automatic token refresh prevents session timeouts
- [ ] Code follows project TypeScript and React patterns
