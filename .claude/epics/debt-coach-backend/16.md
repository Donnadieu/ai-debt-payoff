# Task: Slip Detection Logic

## Description

Implement budget feasibility analysis that detects when monthly budget is insufficient for minimum debt payments and provides specific, actionable remediation suggestions using the defined rule: max($25, ceil(shortfall/25)*$25).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Budget vs minimum payment comparison logic
- [ ] Shortfall calculation when budget < sum(minimum payments)
- [ ] Remediation suggestion algorithm: max($25, ceil(shortfall/25)*$25)
- [ ] API endpoint `/slip/check` with proper request/response schemas
- [ ] Edge case handling (zero budget, no debts, etc.)
- [ ] Clear, actionable suggestion formatting ("Apply $25")
- [ ] Analytics event tracking for slip detection
- [ ] Integration with existing debt calculation engine

## Technical Details

- **Algorithm**: Simple comparison with mathematical suggestion calculation
- **Rule Implementation**: max($25, ceil(shortfall/25)*$25) for remediation amounts
- **Integration**: Uses debt portfolio data from existing schemas
- **Performance**: Immediate response (<50ms for calculation)
- **Files to create**:
  - `slip_detector.py` - Budget analysis and suggestion logic
  - API endpoint integration in `main.py`
  - Schemas for slip detection request/response

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 13 - Core API Foundation (for API structure and schemas)
- [ ] Mathematical validation of suggestion algorithm

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: S
- **Hours**: 3 hours
- **Parallel**: true (independent business logic)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Slip detection algorithm implemented and tested
- [ ] API endpoint functional with proper schemas
- [ ] Suggestion calculation follows specified rule exactly
- [ ] Edge cases handled appropriately
- [ ] Analytics events integrated
- [ ] Unit tests covering all scenarios
