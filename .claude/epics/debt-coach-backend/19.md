# Task: Testing Suite

## Description

Create comprehensive unit and integration tests covering debt calculation algorithms, LLM validation pipeline, slip detection logic, and API endpoints. Must achieve >90% code coverage with meaningful tests including performance benchmarks.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unit tests for debt calculation algorithms (Snowball/Avalanche)
- [ ] LLM validation tests with mock hallucinated responses
- [ ] Slip detection logic tests covering all scenarios
- [ ] API endpoint integration tests
- [ ] Performance tests for 10-debt calculation timing
- [ ] >90% code coverage with meaningful assertions
- [ ] Test fixtures and mock data setup
- [ ] Continuous test execution setup

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: pytest with asyncio support
- **Coverage**: >90% code coverage requirement
- **Performance**: Benchmark tests for <500ms debt calculations
- **Safety**: Mock LLM responses that would fail validation
- **Files to create**:
  - `tests/test_planner.py` - Algorithm unit tests
  - `tests/test_nudge.py` - LLM validation tests
  - `tests/test_slip.py` - Slip detection tests
  - `tests/test_api.py` - API endpoint tests
  - `tests/conftest.py` - Test fixtures and setup

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 13 - Core API Foundation
- [ ] Task 14 - Debt Calculation Engine
- [ ] Task 15 - LLM Integration System
- [ ] Task 16 - Slip Detection Logic

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: L
- **Hours**: 7 hours
- **Parallel**: false (requires completed implementations to test)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All core algorithms tested with edge cases
- [ ] LLM validation prevents hallucinated numbers in tests
- [ ] API endpoints tested with various inputs
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Code coverage >90% achieved
- [ ] Test suite runs reliably in CI/CD
