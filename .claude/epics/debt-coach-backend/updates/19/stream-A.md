# Stream A: Core Algorithm Tests

## Scope
Unit tests for debt calculation engines and business logic

## Files
- `backend/tests/test_planner.py`

## Status
- **Current Status**: completed
- **Progress**: 100%
- **Started**: 2025-01-27T20:45:00Z
- **Completed**: 2025-01-27T21:30:00Z
- **Estimated Completion**: 2.5 hours
- **Dependencies**: none

## Progress
- [x] Test fixtures for debt calculation scenarios
- [x] Snowball algorithm unit tests with edge cases
- [x] Avalanche algorithm unit tests with edge cases
- [x] Performance benchmarks (<500ms for 10 debts)
- [x] Slip detection logic tests
- [x] Input validation tests
- [ ] Snowball algorithm unit tests with edge cases
- [ ] Avalanche algorithm unit tests with edge cases
- [ ] Performance benchmarks (<500ms for 10 debts)

## Completed Tasks
None yet.

## Current Work
Starting implementation of core algorithm tests.

## Next Steps
1. Create test fixtures for various debt scenarios
2. Implement Snowball algorithm tests
3. Implement Avalanche algorithm tests
4. Add performance benchmarks
