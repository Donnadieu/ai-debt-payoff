# Stream A: Core Analytics Infrastructure

## Scope
Analytics event tracking function and core infrastructure

## Files
- `backend/analytics.py`
- `backend/app/core/analytics.py`
- `backend/app/core/performance.py`

## Status
- **Current Status**: completed
- **Started**: 2025-01-27
- **Completed**: 2025-01-27
- **Estimated Completion**: 2-3 hours
- **Dependencies**: None

## Progress
- [x] Event tracking function with console logging
- [x] Performance monitoring hooks
- [x] Integration with external analytics services (stub)

## Completed Tasks
1. **Core Analytics Infrastructure** (`backend/app/core/analytics.py`)
   - Implemented `AnalyticsCore` class with event buffering and batch processing
   - Added `track_event()` method with automatic flushing
   - Created timing utilities with `@track_timing` context manager and `@timed_operation` decorator
   - Built `EventValidator` for event validation before processing
   - Added `AnalyticsConfig` for system configuration
   - Implemented console logging for development environment

2. **Performance Monitoring System** (`backend/app/core/performance.py`)
   - Created `PerformanceMonitor` class with metrics collection
   - Implemented `PerformanceTimer` context manager for operation timing
   - Added system metrics collection (CPU, memory, disk usage)
   - Built performance alerting system with configurable thresholds
   - Created comprehensive performance reporting and health checks
   - Added operation statistics with percentile calculations

## Current Work
Stream A implementation completed successfully.

## Next Steps
Stream A is complete. Stream C can now begin implementation as dependency is satisfied.

## Notes
- All core analytics infrastructure is in place
- Performance monitoring system is fully functional
- Integration hooks ready for external services (Mixpanel, etc.)
- Console logging active for development
- Stream C can now proceed with event schema validation and persistence
