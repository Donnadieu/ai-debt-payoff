# Stream A: Core Algorithm Implementation

## Scope
Snowball and Avalanche calculation algorithms

## Files
- `backend/planner.py` - Core debt calculation algorithms
- Algorithm logic and mathematical functions

## Progress
- ✅ Created planner.py with PayoffCalculator class
- ✅ Implemented Snowball algorithm (smallest balance first)
- ✅ Implemented Avalanche algorithm (highest APR first)
- ✅ Added strategy comparison functionality
- ✅ Implemented input validation for debt portfolios
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling for edge cases

## Status
**COMPLETED** - Core algorithms implemented and ready for optimization
