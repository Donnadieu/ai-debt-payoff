# Stream C: Code Comments & Production Integration

## Scope
Code comment improvements and production integration markers

## Files
- `app/core/calculator.py` - Business logic comments
- `app/services/*` - Service layer documentation
- `app/models/*` - Model field documentation
- `config.py` - Production configuration markers
- `app/workers/*` - Worker process documentation

## Progress

### Summary
All assigned files have been successfully documented with:
- Business logic explanations focusing on debt payoff algorithms and financial calculations
- Production integration markers clearly identifying configuration requirements
- Data access patterns explaining repository usage and transaction management
- Comprehensive validation rules and error handling strategies
- Performance considerations and monitoring integration points

The code is now self-documenting for future developers and clearly marks all production configuration requirements.
