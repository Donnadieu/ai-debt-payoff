# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #18

## Overview
Implement analytics event tracking system with console logging, performance monitoring hooks, and comprehensive event capture at key user interaction points. This monitoring layer can be highly parallelized across different functional areas.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Core Analytics Infrastructure
**Scope**: Analytics event tracking function and core infrastructure
**Files**:
- `backend/analytics.py`
- `backend/app/core/analytics.py`
- `backend/app/core/performance.py`
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 1.5 hours
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream B: API Integration & Middleware
**Scope**: Performance monitoring middleware and API endpoint integration
**Files**:
- `backend/app/middleware/analytics.py`
- `backend/app/middleware/performance.py`
- `backend/main.py` (middleware integration)
- API endpoint modifications for event tracking
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 1 hour
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream C: Event Schema & Validation
**Scope**: Event schema validation, formatting, and database persistence
**Files**:
- `backend/app/schemas/analytics_events.py`
- `backend/app/services/analytics_tracking.py`
- Database integration for event persistence
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: after existing analytics service (Issue #17 completed)
**Estimated Hours**: 1 hour
**Dependencies**: Issue #17 analytics service layer

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
- `backend/main.py` - Middleware registration (coordinate with Stream B)
- `backend/app/services/analytics_service.py` - Event persistence integration

### Sequential Requirements
1. Core analytics infrastructure before API integration
2. Event schemas before database persistence
3. Performance middleware before endpoint integration

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Streams work on different functional layers
- **Medium Risk**: Shared main.py for middleware registration
- **High Risk**: None - well-separated concerns

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: hybrid

Launch Streams A & B simultaneously (core infrastructure + middleware are independent). Start Stream C when Stream A completes and can integrate with existing analytics service from Issue #17.

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- Wall time: 1.5 hours (max of Stream A)
- Total work: 3 hours
- Efficiency gain: 50%

Without parallel execution:
- Wall time: 3 hours

## Notes
- Stream A and B can work completely independently
- Stream C leverages existing analytics service from Issue #17
- All streams should coordinate on event naming conventions
- Performance monitoring can be implemented as FastAPI middleware
- Console logging implementation allows for easy production service integration
- Event tracking points are well-defined and can be implemented in parallel across endpoints
