# Task: Debt Calculation Engine

## Description

Implement the core debt payoff algorithms (Snowball and Avalanche) with comprehensive calculation logic for payment schedules, interest projections, and timeline analysis. Must handle up to 10 debts with <500ms performance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Debt Snowball algorithm (smallest balance first) implemented
- [x] Debt Avalanche algorithm (highest APR first) implemented
- [x] Complete payoff schedule calculation with monthly breakdowns
- [x] Total interest calculation for each strategy
- [x] Payment timeline projection with payoff dates
- [x] Performance requirement: <500ms for 10 debts
- [x] Input validation for debt parameters
- [x] Edge case handling (zero balance, negative values, etc.)

## Technical Details

- **Algorithm Implementation**: Pure Python functions with type hints
- **Performance Target**: <500ms for 10 debts on development hardware
- **Input Validation**: Pydantic schemas for debt portfolio data
- **Output Format**: Structured payoff schedule with per-debt and per-month details
- **Files to create**:
  - `planner.py` - Core debt calculation algorithms
  - `schemas.py` - Debt and payoff plan schemas (extend from task 13)
  - Performance optimization for large debt portfolios

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 13 - Core API Foundation (for models and schemas)
- [ ] Mathematical accuracy validation against manual calculations

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: L
- **Hours**: 7 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can work alongside other business logic tasks)

## Definition of Done

- [x] Both algorithms implemented and tested
- [x] Performance benchmarks met (<500ms for 10 debts)
- [x] Unit tests covering algorithm correctness
- [x] Edge cases handled gracefully
- [x] Integration with API endpoint functional
- [x] Documentation for algorithm logic
