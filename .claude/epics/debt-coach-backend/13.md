# Task: Core API Foundation

## Description

Set up the FastAPI application foundation with basic routing, Pydantic models, and SQLModel database integration. This includes the core project structure, configuration management, and basic API endpoints without business logic.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] FastAPI application with uvicorn server setup
- [ ] Pydantic models for all API request/response schemas
- [ ] SQLModel database models for Debt, Nudge, and analytics events
- [ ] Basic API routing structure with placeholder endpoints
- [ ] Environment-based configuration system (.env support)
- [ ] Database connection and session management
- [ ] Basic error handling and HTTP status codes
- [ ] OpenAPI documentation auto-generation working

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: FastAPI with automatic OpenAPI docs
- **Models**: SQLModel for database, Pydantic for API schemas
- **Configuration**: python-dotenv for environment variables
- **Database**: SQLite with PostgreSQL-ready schema
- **Files to create**:
  - `main.py` - FastAPI app and route definitions

  - `schemas.py` - Pydantic request/response models
  - `config.py` - Environment configuration
  - `database.py` - Database connection setup
  - `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## Dependencies

- [ ] Python 3.10+ environment
- [ ] No task dependencies (foundation task)

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: M
- **Hours**: 6 hours
- **Parallel**: true (no conflicts with other tasks)
