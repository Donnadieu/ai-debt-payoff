# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #14

## Overview

Implement core debt payoff algorithms (Snowball and Avalanche) with comprehensive calculation logic for payment schedules, interest projections, and timeline analysis. Must handle up to 10 debts with <500ms performance requirement.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Core Algorithm Implementation
**Scope**: Snowball and Avalanche calculation algorithms
**Files**:
- `planner.py` - Core debt calculation algorithms
- Algorithm logic and mathematical functions
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 4
**Dependencies**: Task 13 completed (foundation available)

### Stream B: Performance & Validation
**Scope**: Input validation, performance optimization, edge cases
**Files**:
- `planner.py` - Performance optimization functions
- Validation logic and error handling
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: after Stream A core functions
**Estimated Hours**: 2
**Dependencies**: Stream A core algorithms

### Stream C: Testing & Integration
**Scope**: Unit tests, performance benchmarks, API integration
**Files**:
- `test_planner.py` - Unit tests for algorithms
- Performance benchmark tests
- API endpoint integration updates
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: after Stream A completes
**Estimated Hours**: 3
**Dependencies**: Stream A algorithms implemented

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
- `planner.py` - Streams A & B will modify (coordinate algorithm vs optimization code)
- `schemas.py` - May need extensions for payoff plan responses
- `main.py` - Stream C will add endpoint integration

### Sequential Requirements
1. Core algorithms (Stream A) before optimization (Stream B)
2. Algorithm implementation before comprehensive testing (Stream C)
3. Basic functions before performance benchmarking

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Clear separation between algorithm logic, optimization, and testing
- **Medium Risk**: `planner.py` shared between A & B (manageable with coordination)
- **High Risk**: None identified

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: hybrid

Launch Stream A immediately. Start Stream B when core algorithms are functional. Launch Stream C when Stream A algorithms are complete. Streams B & C can run in parallel during final phase.

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- Wall time: 5 hours (Stream A: 4h, then B & C parallel: 3h max)
- Total work: 9 hours
- Efficiency gain: 44%

Without parallel execution:
- Wall time: 9 hours

## Notes
- Performance optimization can happen in parallel with testing once core algorithms exist
- Edge case handling should be integrated during algorithm development, not as separate phase
- API integration testing requires functional algorithms but can run parallel with optimization
- Consider creating performance benchmark data early for consistent testing
