# Task: LLM Integration System

## Description

Build the AI-powered nudge generation system with background workers, LLM prompt generation, strict validation pipeline, and deterministic fallbacks. Must ensure zero hallucinated numbers reach users.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Background worker system (RQ + Redis or threading alternative)
- [ ] Safe LLM prompt template implementation
- [ ] Mock LLM client with configurable responses
- [ ] Post-filter validation pipeline for numeric claims
- [ ] Deterministic fallback templates for failed validations
- [ ] Nudge persistence in database with validation status
- [ ] Integration points marked for real LLM APIs (OpenAI/Anthropic)
- [ ] 100% validation success rate in tests (no hallucinated numbers)

## Technical Details

- **Background Processing**: RQ with Redis or threading for development
- **LLM Integration**: Mock client with real API integration points
- **Validation Pipeline**: Regex extraction + numeric verification against allowed values
- **Safety Guarantee**: Zero tolerance for financial misinformation
- **Files to create**:
  - `nudge_worker.py` - Background job processing and LLM integration
  - `llm_client.py` - Mock LLM client with real integration hooks
  - `validation.py` - Post-filter validation logic
  - Worker configuration and job queue setup

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 13 - Core API Foundation (for database models)
- [ ] Task 14 - Debt Calculation Engine (for plan data validation)
- [ ] Redis server for background jobs (Docker acceptable for dev)

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: XL
- **Hours**: 9 hours
- **Parallel**: false (complex integration requiring sequential implementation)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Background worker system operational
- [ ] LLM prompt generation with debt plan data
- [ ] Validation pipeline prevents all hallucinated numbers
- [ ] Fallback system provides safe alternatives
- [ ] Database persistence for nudges and analytics
- [ ] Integration tests with mock hallucinated responses
- [ ] Clear integration points for production LLM APIs
