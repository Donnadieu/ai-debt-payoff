# Task: Documentation & Deployment

## Description

Create comprehensive documentation including README with exact setup commands, API documentation, sample curl commands for all endpoints, and deployment preparation. Ensure complete project deliverability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Environment configuration examples (.env.example)
- [ ] Code comments explaining business logic
- [ ] Integration points clearly marked for production
- [ ] Deployment preparation and requirements documentation
- [ ] Acceptance criteria validation checklist

## Technical Details

- **API Examples**: Working curl commands for /plan, /nudge/generate, /slip/check
- **Setup**: Virtual environment, dependencies, database, worker setup
- **Integration**: Clear markers for LLM API and production database integration
- **Files to create**:
  - `README.md` - Complete setup and usage guide
  - `.env.example` - Configuration template
