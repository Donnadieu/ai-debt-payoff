# Task: Data Display Components Migration

## Description
Migrate data display components including DebtList, DebtCard, and dashboard components to use MUI Table/DataGrid, Card, and Grid systems. This task focuses on preserving sorting, filtering, and bulk operations functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] DebtList migrated to MUI DataGrid or Table with sorting capabilities
- [ ] DebtCard component migrated to MUI Card with structured content layout
- [ ] Debt filtering implemented using MUI Select/Autocomplete components
- [ ] Bulk operations integrated with MUI Checkbox selection and Toolbar
- [ ] Loading states implemented using MUI Skeleton components
- [ ] Responsive grid layout using MUI Grid system
- [ ] Data pagination implemented with MUI Pagination component
- [ ] Export functionality integrated with MUI Menu and Button components

## Technical Details
- Choose between MUI DataGrid (free version) or Table based on feature requirements
- Implement custom sorting and filtering logic with MUI components
- Create reusable Card component wrapper for debt information display
- Integrate MUI Checkbox for row selection in data tables
- Use MUI Toolbar for bulk action controls

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 34 completed (MUI foundation setup)
- [ ] React Query integration maintained for data fetching
- [ ] Issue #26 coordination (Debt Management Interface)
- [ ] Issue #27 coordination (Dashboard components)

## Effort Estimate
