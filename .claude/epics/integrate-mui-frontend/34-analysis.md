# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #34

## Overview
This task involves setting up MUI theming foundation and migrating core components from Tailwind to MUI. The work can be divided into parallel streams focused on theming and component migration.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Theme Infrastructure
**Scope**: Theme configuration and provider setup
**Files**:
- `src/theme/` (new directory)
- `src/App.tsx` (modify)
- `vite.config.ts` (modify)
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 8
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream B: Component Migration
**Scope**: Migrate Button, Input, and Select components
**Files**:
- `src/components/Button/`
- `src/components/Input/`
- `src/components/Select/`
- `src/components/index.ts`
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: after Stream A completes theme setup
**Estimated Hours**: 8
**Dependencies**: Stream A (theme setup)

### Stream C: Optimization & Integration
**Scope**: Bundle optimization and final integration
**Files**:
- `vite.config.ts` (further optimization)
- `package.json` (dependencies)
- Documentation updates
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: after Stream B completes
**Estimated Hours**: 2
**Dependencies**: Stream A & B

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
- `vite.config.ts` - Both Stream A and C need to modify this file
- `src/App.tsx` - Stream A (theme provider) and Stream B (component usage) both touch this file

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Medium Risk**: Potential conflicts in `vite.config.ts` and `App.tsx`
- **Low Risk**: Component directories are independent
- **Low Risk**: Theme configuration is self-contained

## Parallelization Strategy
**Recommended Approach**: Hybrid

1. Start with Stream A (Theme Infrastructure)
2. Once Stream A completes, start Stream B (Component Migration)
3. Stream C (Optimization) runs after both A and B complete

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- Wall time: 10 hours (8h Stream A + 2h overlap + 0h Stream C)
- Total work: 18 hours
- Efficiency gain: 44% time savings

Without parallel execution:
- Wall time: 18 hours

## Notes
- Stream A must complete before Stream B can begin
- Stream C is dependent on both A and B
- Consider using feature flags if parallel development is needed
- Ensure consistent TypeScript types across all streams
- Document theme tokens and component migration patterns for future reference
