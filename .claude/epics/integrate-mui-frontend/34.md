# Task: MUI Foundation Setup and Theme Configuration

## Description
Establish the foundation for MUI integration by setting up theme configuration, provider wrapper, and migrating basic components (Button, Input, Select). This task creates the infrastructure needed for all subsequent MUI component migrations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] MUI ThemeProvider configured with custom theme matching existing brand colors
- [x] Theme provider wrapper component created and integrated into App.tsx
- [x] Custom theme includes typography, spacing, and color palette definitions
- [x] Button component migrated from Tailwind to MUI Button with all variants
- [x] Input component migrated to MUI TextField with validation states
- [x] Select component migrated to MUI Select with proper dropdown behavior
- [x] Tree-shaking configured in Vite for optimal bundle size
- [x] Basic component exports updated in index.ts

## Technical Details
- Create `src/theme/` directory with theme configuration files
- Implement custom MUI theme with existing color tokens
- Set up responsive breakpoints matching current design
- Configure typography scale and spacing system

- Add proper TypeScript interfaces for theme customization

## Dependencies
