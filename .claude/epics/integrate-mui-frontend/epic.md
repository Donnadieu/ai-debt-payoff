# Epic: integrate-mui-frontend

## Overview
Comprehensive migration from custom Tailwind CSS components to Material-UI (MUI) v7 across the entire frontend application. This epic focuses on replacing 16+ existing custom components with MUI equivalents while maintaining functionality and improving accessibility, consistency, and development velocity.

## Architecture Decisions
- **Component Strategy**: Direct replacement of custom components with MUI equivalents rather than wrapper approach
- **Theming**: Custom MUI theme to match existing brand colors and design tokens
- **Bundle Optimization**: Tree-shaking enabled with selective imports to minimize bundle size impact
- **Integration Pattern**: Gradual migration with backward compatibility during transition
- **Testing Strategy**: Update existing tests to work with MUI components rather than rewriting

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
**Core Component Migrations:**
- Forms: Custom TextField/Select → MUI TextField/Select with react-hook-form integration
- Data Display: Custom tables → MUI DataGrid/Table with sorting/filtering
- Navigation: Custom components → MUI AppBar/Drawer/BottomNavigation
- Feedback: Custom alerts/modals → MUI Alert/Dialog/Snackbar
- Layout: Tailwind Grid → MUI Grid system with responsive breakpoints

**State Management:**
- Maintain existing React Query for data fetching
- Use MUI theme provider for consistent styling
- Preserve existing form validation with Zod schemas

**User Interaction Patterns:**
- Touch-friendly interactions via MUI's built-in touch targets
- Keyboard navigation through MUI's accessibility features
- Focus management in modals and forms

### Backend Services
- **No backend changes required** - API integration layer remains unchanged
- Existing FastAPI endpoints continue to work with new MUI frontend
- React Query integration maintained for data synchronization

### Infrastructure
- **Build System**: Vite configuration updated for MUI tree-shaking
- **Bundle Analysis**: Monitor bundle size to stay within 200KB increase limit
- **Performance**: Lazy loading for heavy MUI components (DataGrid, DatePicker)

## Implementation Strategy
**Phased Migration Approach:**
1. **Foundation**: Theme setup and basic components (Button, Input, Select)
2. **Forms**: Debt management forms with MUI validation integration  
3. **Data Display**: Tables, cards, and dashboard components
4. **Advanced Features**: Strategy comparison, analytics, and coaching interfaces
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design with MUI breakpoints
6. **Testing**: Component test updates and accessibility validation

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Maintain existing component APIs during transition
- Feature flags for gradual rollout if needed
- Comprehensive testing at each phase

## Task Breakdown Preview
High-level task categories (≤10 tasks total):
- [ ] **MUI Foundation Setup**: Theme configuration, provider setup, basic component migration
- [ ] **Form Components Migration**: DebtForm, validation, and input components (Issue #26)
- [ ] **Data Display Components**: Tables, cards, lists, and dashboard layout (Issues #26, #27)
- [ ] **Interactive Components**: Strategy comparison, sliders, steppers (Issue #28)
- [ ] **Analytics & Reporting**: Charts integration, date pickers, export functionality (Issue #29)
- [ ] **Messaging & Notifications**: Coaching interface, alerts, badges (Issue #30)
- [ ] **Responsive & Mobile**: Mobile navigation, touch optimization (Issue #31)
- [ ] **Testing & Documentation**: Test updates, accessibility validation (Issue #32)

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- MUI Core v7.3.2 (already installed)
- MUI Icons v7.3.2 (already installed)
- @mui/x-date-pickers for advanced date controls
- Emotion for CSS-in-JS (already installed)

### Internal Dependencies
- **Blocking**: All front-end-core-funcionality issues (#26-32) must coordinate with this epic
- **Component Library**: Existing custom components in `/src/components/`
- **API Layer**: React Query integration (Issue #25 - completed)
- **Testing Suite**: Jest and React Testing Library setup

### Epic Coordination
- **Critical**: Issues #26-32 must pause Tailwind implementation and depend on MUI epic completion
- **Post-Migration**: All epic issues resume with MUI components instead of custom Tailwind

## Success Criteria (Technical)

### Performance Benchmarks
- Bundle size increase ≤ 200KB
- Component rendering performance maintained or improved
- Lighthouse accessibility score ≥ 95
- Core Web Vitals maintained

### Quality Gates
- 100% component migration coverage
- All existing functionality preserved
- React Hook Form + Zod validation working with MUI
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Acceptance Criteria
- All 16+ custom components replaced with MUI equivalents
- Responsive design working across all breakpoints
- Accessibility compliance through MUI's built-in features
- Developer documentation for MUI component patterns

## Estimated Effort
- **Overall Timeline**: 6 weeks (phased approach)
- **Resource Requirements**: 1 frontend developer
- **Critical Path**: Foundation setup → Form migration → Data display → Advanced features
- **Parallel Work**: Some components can be migrated independently after foundation is complete

**Effort Breakdown:**
- Foundation & Basic Components: 1 week
- Forms & Validation: 1 week  
- Data Display & Dashboard: 1 week
- Interactive & Analytics: 1 week
- Mobile & Responsive: 1 week
- Testing & Documentation: 1 week
