# Epic: Front-End Core Functionality

## Overview

Implement a complete React TypeScript frontend application that integrates with the existing FastAPI backend to provide debt management, strategy comparison, AI coaching, and analytics capabilities. The application will be built with Tailwind CSS, focus on responsive design, and provide a professional user experience for debt payoff planning.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript for type safety and modern development
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS utility-first approach for rapid, consistent styling
- **State Management**: React Context API for global state (debt data, user preferences)
- **Routing**: React Router v6 for client-side navigation
- **API Integration**: Axios for HTTP client with interceptors for error handling
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization (debt progress, strategy comparison)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form for efficient form handling with validation
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library for comprehensive testing

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **Layout System**: Responsive layout with header, sidebar navigation, and main content area
- **Debt Management**: CRUD components for debt creation, editing, and deletion with validation
- **Dashboard**: Overview components showing portfolio summary and key metrics
- **Strategy Comparison**: Interactive components comparing snowball vs avalanche strategies
- **Analytics**: Chart components for progress tracking and reporting
- **AI Coaching**: Message center for displaying coaching nudges and insights
- **Form Components**: Reusable input, button, and validation components

### Backend Integration
- **API Client**: Service layer abstracting all backend endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Global error boundary and user-friendly error messages
- **Loading States**: Loading indicators for all async operations
- **Offline Support**: Local storage backup for critical debt data

### State Management Strategy
- Global Context for debt portfolio data and user settings
- Local state for component-specific UI state (forms, modals)
- Custom hooks for API operations and data fetching
- Optimistic UI updates for better user experience

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)
- Project setup with React + TypeScript + Tailwind
- Basic routing and layout structure
- API client setup and authentication prep
- Reusable UI component library

### Phase 2: Debt Management (Week 2) 
- Debt CRUD operations and forms
- Dashboard with portfolio overview
- Basic responsive design implementation

### Phase 3: Strategy & Analytics (Week 3)
- Strategy comparison interface
- Analytics charts and reporting
- Progress tracking visualization

### Phase 4: AI Integration & Polish (Week 4)
- AI coaching message center
- Final UI/UX polish and testing
- Performance optimization

## Task Breakdown Preview

High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] Project Setup & Infrastructure: React app initialization, development environment, build pipeline
- [ ] UI Component Library: Reusable components (Button, Input, Card, Modal, Charts)
- [ ] API Integration Layer: HTTP client, error handling, authentication hooks
- [ ] Debt Management Interface: Add/edit/delete debt forms, validation, debt list display
- [ ] Dashboard & Overview: Portfolio summary, key metrics, progress indicators
- [ ] Strategy Comparison Tool: Interactive snowball vs avalanche comparison with visualizations
- [ ] Analytics & Reporting: Progress charts, historical data, export functionality
- [ ] AI Coaching Integration: Message center, nudge display, coaching chat interface
- [ ] Responsive Design & Mobile: Mobile-first responsive implementation across all screens
- [ ] Testing & Documentation: Comprehensive test suite, user documentation, deployment setup

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Existing FastAPI backend with stable API endpoints
- Backend CORS configuration allowing frontend domain
- Redis service for real-time features (coaching nudges)

### Internal Dependencies
- Completed backend API documentation
- Backend error response formats standardized
- Database schema stability for debt and analytics models

### Development Dependencies
- Node.js 16+ and npm/yarn for package management
- Modern browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Development environment with hot reload capability

## Success Criteria (Technical)

### Performance Benchmarks
- Initial page load under 3 seconds on 3G connection
- Interactive responses under 100ms for user actions
- Smooth scrolling and animations at 60fps
- Bundle size optimized under 500KB gzipped

### Quality Gates
- TypeScript strict mode with zero errors
- 90%+ test coverage on critical paths
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Cross-browser compatibility verified

### User Experience
- Mobile responsive design working on 320px+ screens
- Intuitive navigation with clear information hierarchy
- Error states with helpful recovery suggestions
- Loading states for all async operations

## Estimated Effort

### Overall Timeline
4 weeks of development with weekly milestones

### Resource Requirements
- 1 full-time developer (frontend focused)
- Access to backend API documentation and support
- Design system guidance (using existing patterns)

### Critical Path Items
1. API client integration and authentication flow
2. Core debt management CRUD operations
3. Strategy comparison calculation display
4. Responsive design implementation across all components
