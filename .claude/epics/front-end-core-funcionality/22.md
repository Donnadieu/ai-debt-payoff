# Task: React TypeScript Project Setup and Infrastructure

## Description
Set up the complete React TypeScript project with modern development tooling, including Vite build system, Tailwind CSS configuration, and development environment setup. This establishes the foundation for all subsequent frontend development work.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React 18+ application initialized with TypeScript configuration
- [ ] Vite build system configured with development and production builds
- [ ] Tailwind CSS installed and configured with custom theme
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier configured for code quality
- [ ] Basic folder structure established for components, pages, services, and types
- [ ] Package.json scripts for development, build, test, and lint
- [ ] Environment variable setup for API endpoints

## Technical Details
- Initialize project using Vite React TypeScript template
- Configure Tailwind CSS with custom color palette matching design system
- Set up TypeScript strict mode configuration
- Create src/ folder structure: components/, pages/, services/, types/, hooks/, utils/
- Configure absolute imports with path mapping (@/ alias)
- Set up development server with hot reload on port 3000
- Configure proxy for backend API calls during development

## Dependencies
- [ ] Node.js 16+ installed in development environment
- [ ] Backend API endpoints documented for integration planning

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8-12
- Parallel: true (independent setup task)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with project structure in place
- [ ] Development server runs successfully with hot reload
- [ ] Build process generates optimized production bundle
- [ ] ESLint passes with zero errors
- [ ] Documentation updated with setup instructions
- [ ] Ready for component development
