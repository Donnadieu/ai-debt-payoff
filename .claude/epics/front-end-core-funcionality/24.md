# Task: UI Component Library Foundation

## Description
Create a comprehensive library of reusable UI components using React TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. These components will serve as the building blocks for all application interfaces, ensuring consistent design and behavior across the debt management application.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Button component with variants (primary, secondary, danger, outline)
- [ ] Input components (text, number, email, password) with validation states
- [ ] Card component for content containers
- [ ] Modal component with overlay and close functionality
- [ ] Loading spinner and skeleton components
- [ ] Alert/notification components for success, error, warning states
- [ ] Form field wrapper with label, error message, and help text
- [ ] Navigation components (header, sidebar, breadcrumbs)

## Technical Details
- Implement components using React functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling with consistent design tokens
- Create component variants using props and conditional classes
- Implement proper accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Use React.forwardRef for components that need DOM element access
- Create Storybook stories for component documentation and testing
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all component props

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 22 completed (project setup with Tailwind CSS)
- [ ] Design system color palette and spacing defined

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20
- Parallel: false (depends on project setup)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All components implemented with TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Components are accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- [ ] Storybook documentation created for each component
- [ ] Unit tests written for component behavior
- [ ] Components exported from index file for easy importing
- [ ] Ready for use in application pages
