# Stream D: Project Structure & Environment Setup

## Scope
Source folder structure, environment variables, path aliases

## Files
- `frontend/src/components/`
- `frontend/src/pages/`
- `frontend/src/services/`
- `frontend/src/types/`
- `frontend/src/hooks/`
- `frontend/src/utils/`
- `frontend/.env.example`
- `frontend/.env.local`
- Updates to `frontend/vite.config.ts` (path aliases)

## Progress
- [x] Verified existing vite.config.ts path aliases (Stream A already set up '@' alias)
- [x] Created complete src/ directory structure:
  - `frontend/src/components/` with index.ts
  - `frontend/src/pages/` with index.ts
  - `frontend/src/services/` with index.ts
  - `frontend/src/types/` with index.ts
  - `frontend/src/hooks/` with index.ts
  - `frontend/src/utils/` with index.ts
- [x] Created environment configuration:
  - `frontend/.env.example` with API endpoints and configuration template
  - `frontend/.env.local` for local development setup
- [x] All directories include index.ts files with export structure comments
- [x] Ready for component and service development

## Notes
- Stream A had already configured path aliases in vite.config.ts with '@' pointing to './src'
- Environment variables follow VITE_ prefix convention for client-side access
- Directory structure follows React/TypeScript best practices for scalable applications
