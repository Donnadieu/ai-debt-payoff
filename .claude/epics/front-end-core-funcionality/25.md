# Task: API Integration Layer and HTTP Client

## Description
Implement a robust API integration layer using Axios for HTTP communication with the FastAPI backend. This includes error handling, request/response interceptors, authentication hooks, and TypeScript interfaces for all API endpoints.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Axios HTTP client configured with base URL and default headers
- [ ] Request interceptors for authentication token attachment
- [ ] Response interceptors for error handling and token refresh
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces for all API request/response types
- [ ] Service classes for each API domain (debts, strategies, analytics, coaching)
- [ ] Custom hooks for API operations with loading states
- [ ] Global error boundary for unhandled API errors
- [ ] Retry logic for failed requests

## Technical Details
- Configure Axios instance with environment-based base URL
- Implement token-based authentication with automatic refresh
- Create TypeScript interfaces matching backend Pydantic models
- Use React Query or SWR for caching and synchronization
- Implement optimistic updates for better UX
- Add request/response logging in development mode
- Handle different error types (network, validation, server errors)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 22 completed (project setup)
- [ ] Backend API documentation available
- [ ] Authentication endpoints defined in backend

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 12-16
- Parallel: true (can work alongside UI components)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] HTTP client configured and tested
- [ ] All API endpoints have TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Error handling works across all scenarios
- [ ] Authentication flow implemented
- [ ] Custom hooks created for data fetching
- [ ] Integration tests written for API layer
