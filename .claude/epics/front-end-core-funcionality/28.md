# Task: Strategy Comparison Tool and Visualization

## Description
Implement an interactive tool that compares debt payoff strategies (snowball vs avalanche) with visual representations, timeline comparisons, and total interest calculations. Users can adjust parameters and see real-time strategy updates.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Side-by-side comparison of snowball vs avalanche strategies
- [ ] Interactive timeline showing payoff order for each strategy
- [ ] Total interest and time savings calculations
- [ ] Adjustable extra payment slider with real-time updates
- [ ] Visual debt payoff timeline with progress bars
- [ ] Strategy recommendation based on user's debt profile
- [ ] Export comparison results to PDF or image
- [ ] Mobile-responsive comparison interface

## Technical Details
- Use Recharts for timeline and comparison visualizations
- Implement strategy calculation algorithms in TypeScript
- Create interactive sliders for payment adjustments
- Use React state for real-time calculation updates
- Add debounced input handling for performance
- Implement chart animations for better UX
- Create printable/exportable comparison reports

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 24 completed (UI components)
- [ ] Task 25 completed (API integration)
- [ ] Task 26 completed (debt data available)
- [ ] Backend strategy calculation endpoints

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20
- Parallel: true (can work alongside dashboard)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Both strategies calculate and display correctly
- [ ] Interactive controls update calculations in real-time
- [ ] Visualizations are clear and informative
- [ ] Comparison results are accurate and helpful
- [ ] Mobile interface is fully functional
- [ ] Performance is optimized for large debt portfolios
