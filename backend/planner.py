"""Debt payoff calculation algorithms (Snowball and Avalanche strategies).

This module provides the core debt payoff calculation engine implementing two primary
debt reduction strategies:

1. **Snowball Method**: Pay off smallest balances first for psychological momentum
2. **Avalanche Method**: Pay off highest interest rates first for mathematical optimization

Both methods maintain minimum payments on all debts while allocating any extra payment
to the priority debt based on the selected strategy.

The algorithms handle complex financial calculations including:
- Monthly compound interest calculations
- Dynamic payment allocation
- Complete payoff timeline generation
- Total interest and time comparisons
- Performance optimization for real-time usage

Production Integration Points:
- Database models: Uses Debt model from models.py
- Performance monitoring: Calculations should complete within 500ms
- Validation: All inputs validated before processing
- Error handling: Graceful degradation for edge cases
