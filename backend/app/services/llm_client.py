"""LLM client service for AI-powered debt coaching and nudge generation.

This service provides the core LLM integration for generating personalized
debt coaching messages, motivational nudges, and financial advice content.

Production Integration Points:
- OpenAI API integration for GPT-based content generation
- Anthropic API integration for Claude-based alternatives
- Content validation and safety filtering
- Rate limiting and cost optimization
- Caching strategies for common prompts

Data Access Patterns:
- Stateless service design for horizontal scaling
- Configuration-driven provider selection (OpenAI/Anthropic/mock)
- Environment-based API key management
- Health check endpoints for monitoring
- Error handling with graceful degradation

Content Generation Strategy:
- Template-based prompts for consistency
- Context-aware personalization using debt data
- Safety validation to prevent financial misinformation
- A/B testing framework for message effectiveness
- Analytics integration for continuous improvement

    LLM client service with multi-provider support and production-ready configuration.
    
    This service abstracts LLM provider integration and provides consistent
    interfaces for AI-powered debt coaching features across the application.
    
    Service Architecture:
    - Provider abstraction: Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, and mock providers
    - Configuration-driven: Provider selection via environment variables
    - Stateless design: No instance state for horizontal scaling
    - Error handling: Graceful degradation with fallback responses
    
    Production Data Access Patterns:
    - API key management via environment variables
    - Rate limiting integration for cost control
    - Response caching for frequently used prompts
    - Health monitoring for service availability
    - Usage analytics for optimization
    
    Content Safety:
    - Input validation prevents prompt injection
    - Response filtering removes financial misinformation
    - Template constraints ensure appropriate messaging
    - Audit logging for compliance and debugging
